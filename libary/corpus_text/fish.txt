She wears a hat full of... air. I guess so. How's that? Like that? Thanks, pal. Hi-ya, Sandy. It’s me, SpongeBob. Sandy! Sandy! Open up! Sandy! Sandy! Sandy, something's gone terribly wrong. There's no water in... ...here. No water? Problem? Hi-yah! That's how I like my air! With no water. I brought you some flowers. Yes, I'm okay. I can’t imagine why. Water would be nice. Take your time. I gotta get out of here! Aaaaahh! I don't need water! Water's for quitters! I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it, I don't need it... I don't need it, I don't need it, I definitely don't need it. I don't need it. I don't need it. I don't need it. I don't need it. I need it! I'm a quitter! Air is not good, Patrick. Air is not good. I tried to tell you! You're... doing it... wrong... Ahh, what a wonderful day. The sun is out, the water is shimmering, scallops are chirping. So peaceful. Oh, sure thing, Squidward. Okay. Hey, Squidward. Wanna blow some bubbles? Only 25 cents. Uh huh. Good morning to you, sir. Would you care to blow a bubble? Only a quarter. Sure thing, Patrick. Thank you. One bubble wand, dipped and ready to go. Could I interest you in some lessons? Only 25 cents. Okay, Patrick, it's all in the technique. First go like this, spin around. Stop! Double take three times: one, two, three. Then pelvic thrust! Whoooo! Whooooooo! Stop on your right foot, don't forget it! Now it's time to bring it around town. Bring-it-a-round-town.

We're making bubble art. Watch carefully. First go like this, spin around. Stop! Double take three times: one, two, three. Then pelvic thrust! Whoooo! Whooooooo!

Hey, Squidward, remember the technique. Squidward, technique! You do this, and this, step back.... Spin around like thi— Like this... Look at me, over here, one... two.... yeah, three... Look, we're doing the technique! And don't for... Don't forget the "Woooooo!" Squidward? Technique! Technique! Technique! You're not doing the technique. All right, Squid. That was so good. No. You said it, Squidward. See, it is all in the technique. Squidward! What a great day. Hey, Sandy! Look! I'm Sandy! Hey Sandy, who am I? Hello, SpongeBob. Could you keep it down? I'm trying to be boring. Did anyone order twenty pepperoni and sand pizzas? Coming. Good job, Sandy. Well, that's about enough for today, don't you think? All right, stand back, everyone. Could I borrow a couple of these? I got it! Incoming! Oops, I guess I ripped my pants again! Hey, Sandy, how about throwing it to me? I could use a hand here! I guess so... ...except I ripped my pants! I'll take a banana split. That's okay. I already split my pants! Get it? How about ripple? No, thanks, already got one! Is that a burger you're eating? You know what would go good with that? Ripped... pants. Ripped pants a la mode! Delivery! Did you order twenty cases of ripped pants? Come closer. I need... I need... A tailor. Because I ripped my pants! Come on, SpongeBob, you're losing them! Think! Your public's waiting. Let's see... "Lifting weights - big laugh," "Frisbee in face - kills," "Surfing - knocks 'em dead," "Pretending to drown," No. Come on, think! I got it! Hey, everybody! Not ripped pants! Pants ripped off. Huh? Someone call the police. There's a pants thief on the loose! Oh, no, everybody's gone, even Sandy. She'd rather hang out with Larry! Oh, no. We blew it, pants. Oh, I didn't have to be a fool to get Sandy's attention. Am I the biggest loser on the beach?! Ouch. I lost my best friend. When I ripped... my pants. I thought that I had everybody by my side, but I went and blew it all sky-high, and now she won't even spare a passing glance, all just because I ripped my pants. ♪I know I shouldn't mope around, I shouldn't curse, but the pain feels so much worse. 'Cause winding up with no one is a lot less fun than a burn from the sun...♪ ♪Now I learned a lesson I won't soon forget... so listen and you won't regret. Be true to yourself; don't miss your chance... and you won't end up like the fool... who... ripped... his... pants!♪ Sandy! Absolutely, buddy. I think I've got it! Wait a minute... Hey, Squidward, we're jellyfishing. Wait! We made a net especially for you! Do you want to come with us? Next time? You know, Patrick? It always seems like Squidward never has time for fun. No, are you kidding? We're his best friends. Squid's back! Hey, Patrick, Squid's home! And we're gonna make sure he's greeted by his two best friends! Us! Let's go! Welcome home, Squidward! We're gonna make this your best day ever! Well, your best day's sure not gonna be out there. I don't think soup is the best thing for him on his best day ever. How about some music on your best day ever? Played on your very own clarinet. Sorry, my lips are a little dry. But what is best is what we saved for last. The one sure-fire thing to make your best day ever the best day ever! This is Jellyfish Fields, where wild jellyfish roam just waiting to be captured. No, no, Squid! Over here! I know you're eager, but you don't even have your net. Patrick, fix him up while I find him a good specimen. There's one in position. Ready... set... go! Hey, look! Squid's doing it! He's a natural! Yeah, you're doing great! Go, Squid, go! Yeah, you got, Squid! Be the net! Yeah, go by the eye of the tiger, by the eye of the tiger, by the eye of the tiger! Better, better, better! Yeah, yeah, yeah! You've got it now! This is really your best day ever, isn't it? Hey, Patrick. Well... Thought yesterday went... pretty well, don't you think? Me too. Oh, great. Hey, Squid! How about that... ...best day ever? Um, we're really sorry about what happened yesterday, Squidward. Um, we got you a present! It's the jellyfish. You're not still mad, are you? Oui, oui. Un Krabby Patty, Monsieur. First, les patty. Next, les ingredients. Ah, oui! Les mustard. Les hold on a second! And voila! It's under your nose! Look at it, Squidward. Mr. Krabs' gift to all of Bikini Bottom -- the Krabby Patty.. I swear I'm not doing anything. Mr. Krabs! The Krabby Patty is haunted! Uh..Plankton, sir? Okay, Mr. Krabs, see you tomorrow! Plankton? What do you want? Um...no. No. I...guess so. Wow! A golden spatula! And it's even got my name on it. A booster seat? You just want to be friends so you can get your hands on a Krabby Patty! And I bet it's not even your birthday tomorrow. You'll never get a Krabby Patty from me! Even if we are friends! Never, never, never, never! Good night, Gary. Morning already? I... I feel a little funny today. Time for a well-balanced breakfast. This isn't what I had in mind. Let me just grab my pants. I guess I'm not wearing any pants today. I guess I'm not using the door either. See you later, Gary! ...I guess. You're right, Gary! There is something wrong with me! Squidward! Squidward! Wake up! I need some help! Squidward! Help! Help! Something must be wrong with my brain! Plankton! What kind of friend are you? Get out of my head! Leave my brain alone! Never! Never! No, never! You can't fool me, Plankton, you want the Krabby Patty secret formula! No, no, no! There's no one here. I must fight! I just have to say I'm sorry I let Mr. Krabs down. I let all of Bikini Bottom down. But worst of all, I let you down,you delicate little Krabby Patty. With your tasty, juicy, scrumptious, warm, steamy goodness. I'll never forget your 100% all-secret patty, secretly assembled with undersea cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomato, onion, all secretly steamed between two fluffy seaweed-sea buns. Well, patty, I guess we can go home now. Patrick, you're my best friend in the whole neighborhood. Of course, Patrick. Anyone with eyes can see that. Patrick, what are you talking about? Yeah, well, that means that, uhh... so are you! What's that? Well, you're a bigger one! What? Oh, yeah? Well, it doesn't matter what you call me, 'cause I never wanna see you again anyway! Aww, tartar sauce! Ahh, who needs them? They're no fun anyway, right, Gary? Gary? Ah, what am I worried about? I got plenty of friends! I can name three right off the bat! Uhh... The gang's all here... Ohhh! Oh, boy, now's my chance! Don't worry, Squidward! I'm coming! Hang on! I'll save you! Hold on! Friend... Don't worry, Squiddy, old pal. That's what friends are for. So dumb Patrick fell asleep on ya, huh? Some friend. A real friend would perform for you! Are you kidding? I've been playing bassinet for years! Give me an A, buddy! Squidward is my best friend in the world. Squidward is my best friend in the sea... Squidward... And Patrick is a dirty, stinky, rotten friend stealer! Umm, I can fix this. ...So, uhh, I'll see you tomorrow, Squidward! Call me! What's the matter, Squidward, old buddy? Oh, ho-ho! So this is what I find, huh?! My best friend and my ex-best friend and... ...rubber bath toys! You're just a backbiting, backstabbing silly blob of... Buddy! Where'd ya go, friend? Squidward. A dinner party? I'd love to! Did you miss me? I'd much rather dine with you than that lousy... Say, what gives?! I'm not sitting near that maniac! Yes, please! Thanks, friend. Thanks, best friend! Wait, I need some more!
