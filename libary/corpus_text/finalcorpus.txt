No. You said it, Squidward. See, it is all in the technique. Squidward! What a great day. Hey, Sandy! Look! I'm Sandy! Hey Sandy, who am I? Hello, SpongeBob. Could you keep it down? I'm trying to be boring. Did anyone order twenty pepperoni and sand pizzas? Coming. Good job, Sandy. Well, that's about enough for today, don't you think? All right, stand back, everyone. Could I borrow a couple of these? I got it! Incoming! Oops, I guess I ripped my pants again! Hey, Sandy, how about throwing it to me? I could use a hand here! I guess so... ...except I ripped my pants! I'll take a banana split. That's okay. I already split my pants! Get it? How about ripple? No, thanks, already got one! Is that a burger you're eating? You know what would go good with that? Ripped... pants. Ripped pants a la mode! Delivery! Did you order twenty cases of ripped pants? Come closer. I need... I need... A tailor. Because I ripped my pants! Come on, SpongeBob, you're losing them! Think! Your public's waiting. Let's see... "Lifting weights - big laugh," "Frisbee in face - kills," "Surfing - knocks 'em dead," "Pretending to drown," No. Come on, think! I got it! Hey, everybody! Not ripped pants! Pants ripped off. Huh? Someone call the police. There's a pants thief on the loose! Oh, no, everybody's gone, even Sandy. She'd rather hang out with Larry! Oh, no. We blew it, pants. Oh, I didn't have to be a fool to get Sandy's attention. Am I the biggest loser on the beach?! Ouch. I lost my best friend. When I ripped... my pants. I thought that I had everybody by my side, but I went and blew it all sky-high, and now she won't even spare a passing glance, all just because I ripped my pants. ♪I know I shouldn't mope around, I shouldn't curse, but the pain feels so much worse. 'Cause winding up with no one is a lot less fun than a burn from the sun...♪ ♪Now I learned a lesson I won't soon forget... so listen and you won't regret. Be true to yourself; don't miss your chance... and you won't end up like the fool... who... ripped... his... pants!♪ Sandy! Absolutely, buddy. I think I've got it! Wait a minute... Hey, Squidward, we're jellyfishing. Wait! We made a net especially for you! Do you want to come with us? Next time? You know, Patrick? It always seems like Squidward never has time for fun. No, are you kidding? We're his best friends. Squid's back! Hey, Patrick, Squid's home! And we're gonna make sure he's greeted by his two best friends! Us! Let's go! Welcome home, Squidward! We're gonna make this your best day ever! Well, your best day's sure not gonna be out there. I don't think soup is the best thing for him on his best day ever. How about some music on your best day ever? Played on your very own clarinet. Sorry, my lips are a little dry. But what is best is what we saved for last. The one sure-fire thing to make your best day ever the best day ever! This is Jellyfish Fields, where wild jellyfish roam just waiting to be captured. No, no, Squid! Over here! I know you're eager, but you don't even have your net. Patrick, fix him up while I find him a good specimen. There's one in position. Ready... set... go! Hey, look! Squid's doing it! He's a natural! Yeah, you're doing great! Go, Squid, go! Yeah, you got, Squid! Be the net! Yeah, go by the eye of the tiger, by the eye of the tiger, by the eye of the tiger! Better, better, better! Yeah, yeah, yeah! You've got it now! This is really your best day ever, isn't it? Hey, Patrick. Well... Thought yesterday went... pretty well, don't you think? Me too. Oh, great. Hey, Squid! How about that... ...best day ever? Um, we're really sorry about what happened yesterday, Squidward. Um, we got you a present! It's the jellyfish. You're not still mad, are you? Oui, oui. Un Krabby Patty, Monsieur. First, les patty. Next, les ingredients. Ah, oui! Les mustard. Les hold on a second! And voila! It's under your nose! Look at it, Squidward. Mr. Krabs' gift to all of Bikini Bottom -- the Krabby Patty.. I swear I'm not doing anything. Mr. Krabs! The Krabby Patty is haunted! Uh..Plankton, sir? Okay, Mr. Krabs, see you tomorrow! Plankton? What do you want? Um...no. No. I...guess so. Wow! A golden spatula! And it's even got my name on it. A booster seat? You just want to be friends so you can get your hands on a Krabby Patty! And I bet it's not even your birthday tomorrow. You'll never get a Krabby Patty from me! Even if we are friends! Never, never, never, never! Good night, Gary. Morning already? I... I feel a little funny today. Time for a well-balanced breakfast. This isn't what I had in mind. Let me just grab my pants. I guess I'm not wearing any pants today. I guess I'm not using the door either. See you later, Gary! ...I guess. You're right, Gary! There is something wrong with me! Squidward! Squidward! Wake up! I need some help! Squidward! Help! Help! Something must be wrong with my brain! Plankton! What kind of friend are you? Get out of my head! Leave my brain alone! Never! Never! No, never! You can't fool me, Plankton, you want the Krabby Patty secret formula! No, no, no! There's no one here. I must fight! I just have to say I'm sorry I let Mr. Krabs down. I let all of Bikini Bottom down. But worst of all, I let you down,you delicate little Krabby Patty. With your tasty, juicy, scrumptious, warm, steamy goodness. I'll never forget your 100% all-secret patty, secretly assembled with undersea cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomato, onion, all secretly steamed between two fluffy seaweed-sea buns. Well, patty, I guess we can go home now. Patrick, you're my best friend in the whole neighborhood. Of course, Patrick. Anyone with eyes can see that. Patrick, what are you talking about? Yeah, well, that means that, uhh... so are you! What's that? Well, you're a bigger one! What? Oh, yeah? Well, it doesn't matter what you call me, 'cause I never wanna see you again anyway! Aww, tartar sauce! Ahh, who needs them? They're no fun anyway, right, Gary? Gary? Ah, what am I worried about? I got plenty of friends! I can name three right off the bat! Uhh... The gang's all here... Ohhh! Oh, boy, now's my chance! Don't worry, Squidward! I'm coming! Hang on! I'll save you! Hold on! Friend... Don't worry, Squiddy, old pal. That's what friends are for. So dumb Patrick fell asleep on ya, huh? Some friend. A real friend would perform for you! Are you kidding? I've been playing bassinet for years! Give me an A, buddy! Squidward is my best friend in the world. Squidward is my best friend in the sea... Squidward... And Patrick is a dirty, stinky, rotten friend stealer! Umm, I can fix this. ...So, uhh, I'll see you tomorrow, Squidward! Call me! What's the matter, Squidward, old buddy? Oh, ho-ho! So this is what I find, huh?! My best friend and my ex-best friend and... ...rubber bath toys! You're just a backbiting, backstabbing silly blob of... Buddy! Where'd ya go, friend? Squidward. A dinner party? I'd love to! Did you miss me? I'd much rather dine with you than that lousy... Say, what gives?! I'm not sitting near that maniac! Yes, please! Thanks, friend. Thanks, best friend! Wait, I need some more! There ya go. More please! Squidward! Squidward! Squidward! Squidward! Squidward! Squidward! Squidward! Squidward! Guess what, Squidward? Don't you want us to help you clean this up a little?

Okay, thirty-eight. No, Gary, I'm not walking. What is it, Patrick? Oh, Patrick, I'm not in the mood. Okay, now what, Patrick? Okay, I'm at the closet. I don't know, Patrick. Pat, don't do that. I've got too much to worry about. I can't pass my boating exam. I've taken it thirty-seven... ...uhh, thirty-eight times. I know all the answers... ...until I get behind the wheel. I just need something to help me think straight. How are we going to do that? Hey! I can hear you in my head! This is great! While I'm taking the test, you can give me all the answers. Wait a minute, Patrick. Won't I look silly with this antenna coming out of my head? Sponge to Pat, I read you loud and clear, over. Moo. Here you go, ma'am. Uhh... Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff!

Oh no! Shellphone! I know, I'll call Squidward. He'll know what to do! Squidward! Squidward! Help me! My house is shrinking and I woke up this morning and it was getting smaller and smaller... Oh no! Ohh... nematodes. The only thing left of my house is this little pebble. I've got bad news, guys! Look at what happened to my house! It's gone! It's all gone. What am I going to do? Where am I going to live? I guess I'll have to move back with my mom and dad. We can't build a house! Alright, Patrick, lets get to work! Yeah! So what do you think? Really? One bedroom. Well, looks like we've got to move back with Mom and Pop. That'd be great! Good night, rockmate. Good night, Gary. Oh...what the...? No, Patrick, no, Patrick, no, Patrick, no, Patrick! Wake up! Wake up! It's me, SpongeBob! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Squidward, could we stay here a couple of days or a month or two? Thanks. Thanks, Squidward. Squidward, could you scoot over a little? While you're at it, could you get me a glass of water? Yeah, this is a real swell place you got here. Thanks, buddy. Yeah, I like sleepovers. Yep, this is great. Good night, Squidward. Don't worry, Squidward. I'll come visit you. Here come my parents. Hi, Mom. Just give me a minute. I cannot hold onto you any longer, little pebble. You hold too many memories. Well, Squidward, this is goodbye. Goodbye, Patrick. Goodbye, Bikini Bottom. My house is back! Aww! Good old pineapple! It was exactly where it used to be! Aww, Squidward, isn't this great? I'm back forever! Come on, Barnacle Boy. There's evil afoot. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy spot their arch enemy, Reflecto, up to no good. You know what this means. By the power of Neptune. Creatures of the deep, assemble! Think... harder... Barnacle Boy. Here they come. Blast, Reflecto has become too powerful. If Reflecto is cut off from sunlight, he becomes weak. Quick, Barnacle Boy, back to the sea cave. Reflecto has found our secret lab. Elaborate, you vile fiend. Hmm, they must be working undercover. Excuse me, I know that Mermaid Man is working undercover on an important case, but you think we can see him? Patrick! Can you believe it? Are you Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy? But you can't retire! There's evil afoot! All I said was, there's evil afoot. Wow, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. What do you mean, Patrick? Old people are the greatest. They're full of wisdom and experience. The world needs Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Someone, somewhere, is in trouble, and I won't rest until Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are out of retirement. Hey, Mermaid Man. Hold on. Just let me look at ya. Do you remember the time the food supply in Atlantis was running low? So you invented a ray gun that makes things grow six times their size to shoot at the kelp gardens. But then the evil Man Ray swoops down and swipes the gun away and shoots all the algae. And he globs onto the undersea dome. And he starts sucking on the glass. You guys are the greatest heroes of all time, and I think you should come out of retirement. No, but I'm married. Oh, mah. This purse is so big and heavy. Hay-lp! Hay-lp! Hay-lp! Wha, are you here to rescue little ol' me? Ever alert, Mermaid Man has trained himself to sleep with his eyes open. Excuse me, Mermaid Man. This'll cheer you up. We're almost done painting your invisible boatmobile. Pinch me, I must be dreaming. Mission accomplished, Patrick. Wow. That was even better than the old show. One cryin' Johnny comin' up! First bun, then patty, followed by ketchup, mustard, pickles, extra onions, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, and bun, in that order. One cryin' Johnny! Up! Bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun. One dozen cryin' cows on the farm! Up! I got it already, Squidward. Bubble Bass. Yep. I hear talk you're kinda picky. Well then... here ya go! Well, Bubble Bass, whaddaya think? No! But, the pickles should be right where they always are. I know I put them on! Where are those pickles? Pickles? Pickles? Pickles? Mr. Krabs, I know I put pickles on that Krabby Patty. Wait! Wait! Wait! Okay, I am not gonna blow it this time. Let's see. Bun down. Then ketchup, then mustard, then pickles? No! That's not right! Bun down. Mustard, then ketchup, lettuce, then the pickles? No!

I can't remember how to do anything. Oh, no, Mr. Krabs. Who will make the Krabby Patties? Mr. Krabs is right. I need to get my head straight. Now is it bun, patty, ketchup... The door! The door! Mr. Krabs, the front door is missing! Oh. Sorry about that, Mr. Krabs. This pickle thing has got my head all messed up. I better go on home and rest my brain. Uhh, which way do I live? Of course. No, no! Was it bun, patty, bun... Let's see, tomatoes, pickles, bun? No. Bun? No. Bun? No. Shoe? I am so confused! Maybe a good night's sleep will help me get my head on straight. Oh... was it mattress, mattress, sheets, pillow, then SpongeBob? Or... D'oh... think, Sponge! Oh yeah! It was mattress, SpongeBob, mattress, then sheets, pillow. Good night, Gary. Aw, this isn't right. Good night, Gary. Wait, this isn't right either. Nope. Nuh-uh. Negative. C'mon, c'mon! Get it right. Wrong. Wrong! Wrong! Nope! Naw! Negatory! Nyet! Aww, I almost had it! Alarm clock. D'oh, how do I turn this thing off? Think, think, think, think! Gary! Mr. Krabs, hello. Do you how do? I anything can't do right since because pickles. I think don't ready back to go to work, Mr. Krabs. I how do that? Mr. Krabs, I don't know if I... No, no, no, no, no. I got it! I got it! It's all very clear to me now, Mr. Krabs! Yes! I finally realize that I can't do it! I can't do it, Mr. Krabs! I'm a failure! Don't you get it, you crustaceous cheapskate? I can't make a Double Krabby Patty with the works! I can't put a patty on a bun, with lettuce, cheese, onions, tomatoes, ketchup, mustard, pickles, and top bun together in that order! I'm right here, Bubble Bass. This is where I belong! . Rawr. I didn't. Wait a minute! Look! He's been hiding the pickles under his tongue the whole time! And three cheers for the fry cook who took my place when I was gone: Squidward! Hip hip... Hip hip... Hip hip... Hip hip... Yahoo! Hall monitor SpongeBob reporting for duty, ma'am! I am ready to assume my position... in the hall! I will protect all that are weak... in the hall! All rules will be enforced... in the hall! I can't accept that yet, ma'am. First, I have to make my speech. Classmates! Who am I to deserve such a great honor? Why, I would be nothing without Mrs. Puff. And to my public, all I can say is I'm touched. And furthermore, I will carry out my duties... ...crime and punishment, punishment and crime in the hall! Which reminds me of an extremely long speech written by the greatest hall monitor of all time. "Friends, students, juvenile delinquents, lend me your ears." In conclusion, and without a moment to spare, I will put on this uniform and assume my duties as... ...hall monitor! Wish me luck, Mrs. Puff! Oh, and I will be re... I overdid the speech again, didn't I? Aww, tartar sauce. I guess I won't be needing this. I hardly knew ya. Yes, Mrs. Puff? A-hoo! Thanks, Mrs. Puff! Broken traffic light! Who's to say my monitor duties should end just because the bell rang? I can be helpful anywhere! This looks like a job for the hall monitor! What would this town do without you, SpongeBob? On patrol. I'm on patrol. Uh-oh, an open window. The fools. They've left themselves susceptible to danger. I must show them the error of their ways through example. I'm the open window maniac! I hope you learned a valuable lesson! On patrol. I'm on patrol. I'm on patrol... Vandals! Another crime. hmm...strawberry! I must act! Patrick... Patrick... Patrick... Patrick! Down here! Patrick. Come down here. I'm down here. That's hall monitor to you! Sorry's not good enough, Patrick. You've committed a crime, and I'm taking you in. "Maniac. Bikini Bottom? Car wrecks? Break-in?". Who better to bring this maniac to justice than me, the hall monitor! But I can't handle this case alone. Patrick, are you ready to give up your life of crime? Hmmm... now you just need a symbol of authority. Perfect! It is our duty to catch this maniac and bring him to justice! But how to proceed? Listen, deputy, you're an ex-criminal. What would you do? Okay, now what? This isn't working. We've got to do something else. Something with walkie-talkies! And now, duty calls! Alright, deputy, I'll go that way, you go some different way! Run ‘em out! SpongeBob here, Patrick. Report. Get a hold of yourself, deputy. Poor rookie. Alright, I'm on my way back. Just put on your siren and I'll be right there. Where is he, Patrick? That's where I am! He's right on top of me, but I can't see him! What's he doing? Say again, deputy? Huh, this guy's not half-bad-looking for a maniac. Wait a minute, Patrick, I'm the maniac! Yes, Mrs. Puff? Safety first. A-ha! I finally gotcha! Ah, there is nothing better than the taste of natural jelly from a jellyfish. See you later! Oh, oh my glasses! Thanks, little guy! Bye! I can't play anymore, jellyfish. I got to get home. No. You can't go home with me. Jellyfish, you've got to stay here! Hey! Stay! Stay... Jellyfish! For the last time, you cannot come home with me! Ahh, what the heck! Squidward! Hey, Squidward! Squidward! Squidwardiard! Squidward! Look at my new pet! No he isn't! Watch this! Fetch! How many fingers am I holding up? Play dead! Well, we're going to my house to have a little fun. Whew! Wow, you sure like to dance. Well, that's enough for tonight. It's time to go to bed. Huh? You got it all wrong, little fella. Bed. Repeat after me. Bed! We'll just keep you right here. Quit worrying, Gary. He'll be just fine. Good night, everybody. Good morning, Gary. Good morning, jellyfish. Jellyfish? Jellyfish? Here, jellyfish. Oh, jelly! Oh, jellyfi-! Where'd you all come from? Okay, that's it. Party is over! You guys have overstayed your welcome. This music is way too loud. Very funny. I'm serious! Come on, guys, enough is enough! Huh? Uh-oh!Hey, take it easy! Ow! Okay, I'll talk to him! Squidward! Would it be possible to play your clarinet a little... better? I don't think the jellyfish like it. Okay, he said he'll play better. Uh-oh! That's not better! Hey! Take it easy with that! Those are my things! Don't break th- Dow! Hey, now, that wasn't nice! Okay, that is it! Everybody out! Come on, Gary! Gary, you were right. Thanks for not rubbing it in. Huh? They stopped? Gary! Don't... stop... shaking it! Hey, Sandy. Hey, Sandy. Hey, Sandy! Wow! What is it? Wow, what are you gonna do with it? The moon! Can I go? But I don't take up that much space! See? I can fit in here. Mmm, cozy. Well, how about... This? Or this? Or this? Fine. Put me in the brig, I don't mind! Oh, please, can I go? Can I? Can I? Huh? Please? Yeah! Goin' to the moon! Moon ride! Moon ride! Moon ride! Wow, look at that pop gun. Are we gonna go hunting aliens on the moon? Well, when you're done playing with rocks, you could use that for some serious alien hunting. Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. How could you be so naïve? There's evidence all around us. How do you explain Atlantis, cow licks, 99¢ stores? And how about those mysterious circles that pop up in kelp fields over night? Ah! There's one now! Oh, hurry up! These oughta do the trick. What is it, Patrick? Can't you see I'm sleeping here? A present? There are no aliens, Patrick. Just ask Sandy. Alien repellent? Let me see that. New Alien-Out Window Protectant. Does not stop burglars. Well, I guess you're right, Patrick. We'd better go spray those windows! It's pretty impressive, all right. We're just here to spray the windows, Patrick! We don't, we're just spraying the... ...windows. Yeah, just don't touch anything. Patrick, cut that out! Patrick, come on, we can't hang around in here. This is Sandy's big rocket, not some kind of a fun... ...house? Hey, Patrick, what game was that, anyway? Patrick, I don't think we should... No more! Okay, one more. Okay, that's enough. Let's go. Patrick, what are you doing? I'm the space traveler here and I happen to know that that particular button is right over here. Look! We're in space now! Wee! Hey! You got your toothpaste in my peanut butter! Patrick, I can do this! We must be landing. Wait, don't go near it, Patrick! Can't you see this is all a trick? The aliens are projecting our memories onto the environment! They're trying to confuse us, Patrick. Okay, but I'm not gonna to fall for it! Yeah! Sandy. I forgot about her. She's gonna hate us for stealing her rocket. But won't she feel silly when I bring home a real live alien? Aww, she'll love me! Come on, Patrick, the more, the merrier! Shh, quiet, Patrick, don't let them know we're onto them! Uh, yeah, alien hunting. I saw that on TV, too. Gee, Patrick, let's drop in on our old pal Squidward and see what he's up to. Make sure your gun is pumped. Look at it, Patrick, it's disgusting. It's even uglier up close. Let's begin the analysis. Patrick, do you know what this thing is? No, it's an egg sack! Let's look at the embryo. Let's capture the little phony! We don't want your money, moon man! Look at them squirming around in there. Well, there's plenty more where those came from. There's no time for that! Just push harder. Nice try, Sandy. It just goes to show you: you can't trust anyone. So, you were an alien all the time and you didn't even tell me! Yeah? Well, I got you now. Boy, I can't wait to see the look on Sandy's face when she sees this! Sandy, I'm back! Wow, Bikini Bottom sure looks different. Uh-oh... Oh, uhh, Mr. Krabs, can I get my paycheck? Uhh, sir, I can't see you. The boots are in the way. Wow, really? Why is that, they just look like any old ordinary boots. Who's that? ♪I'm ready! I'm ready! I want those boots!♪ Hmmm.. I know! What if I give you my Krusty Krab paycheck? And what if I paint the Krusty Krab for free? And I'll throw in a year's supply of French fry orders! And... Hey, Squidward. Do you like my new boots? Pretty cool, huh? Now, I'm an official fry cook! Hey, Mr. Krabs! Are you kidding? I love them! Could the world's greatest fry cook do this? Or could he do this? Or this? And watch this, Mr. Krabs! Could the greatest fry cook do that, Mr. Krabs? And watch this, Mr. Krabs. And this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this. Gary, these boots have changed my life. I'm never taking them off. Good night, Gary. Mr. Krabs! Oh, Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry! Sorry! Sorry! I'm sorry! No, it's not okay! I lost the boots! Your valuable boots, it's my fault, I let you down! Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Ohh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Yes, it is! They're not the same! You were right. I wasn't ready for those blessed boots. I heard his order, Mr. Krabs. He says he wants . Could the world's greatest fry cook do this?... And this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this... Umm, why did you eat my boots, Mr. Krabs? You really think so, Mr. Krabs? Bye, Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs, what do we do? Well, I. Well, I've been thinking. No offense, Mr. Krabs, but I've been thinking about giving up my cold industrial life in favor of a more natural and free life among the jellyfish. I can too last more than one day. I'll show him. Aw, barnacles! And Squidward, I want you to have my can opener. It's all yours. All yours, old friend. Patrick, there is one more thing I want you to have. No, Sandy, I'm giving up my material possessions to live in the wild with the jellyfish. Oh, oh, Sandy. That's exactly the response I would expect from someone who lives the sham of a life I once lived. I'm gonna prove I don't need all this stuff to be happy. Maybe someday you'll wise up and join me. Goodbye. I won't be needing these. Buzz, buzz, buzz. I'm home. I'm home! I'm home! I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home! Brothers and sisters, wait for me! Buzz buzz. Buzz buzz. Okay, I'm here! Wait, I just got here. My jellyfish instincts tell me to go... ...that way. Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz. This is the life. Hey, everybody, buzz buzz. Buzz to you. Buzz, buzz, nice current today. Hey, what's the buzz? Hello, I'm JellyBob, and you are? Uhh... nice to meet you. Patrick, I'm not coming home. I'm happy here. This is my home now. Hey, everybody! I'm back! I think I'm getting the hang of this. Patrick! What are you doing? Patrick! Go home! I'm a jellyfish now! Patrick! No! Well, that's over. Back to jellyfish matters. Mmm, jelly. Ah, my jellyfish brethren are returning. Greetings, comrades! Being a jellyfish sure is fun. Buzz. Buzz. Buzz. Hey! Eww, I'm itchy! Itchy, why am I so itchy! Ah! Poison sea urchins! Ow, ow, oh, itches. Ow, ow, itches. Buzz. Buzz. Buzz. Krabby Patties. Sandy. What have I done? I had a great life and friends, and I gave all of that up. You guys are the best! I made a huge mistake. Please forgive me! Don't mind if I do. Aye, aye, captain! Don't mind if I do. Ta-da. Aww. It is great to be home! Yeah! So long, Squidward, bye-bye, don't do anything I wouldn't do. Umm, Squidward, why are you playing that drum? Squidward! You need bed rest! I'll keep you safe until you're well again. Uhh, Wednesday? Does everybody know about Opposite Day? Oh, a game. Quiet and out of the way! Yay! I love... I mean, I hate Opposite Day. I'm not ready! Gary! It's Opposite Day and I... ...walk, don't run. And I'm gonna... opposite... opposite... I'm just gonna crawl into bed and do nothing all day. Too bad it only comes once a year, huh, Gary? Gary, where’s your holiday spirit? Company! I hate company. Who's there? Patrick... go away! I never want to see you again! That's right! You're my worst enemy! Patrick, you're not really not my friend. It's just Opposite Day! You have? Well, whatever you normally do, today you do the opposite. Patrick! Patrick, breathe! Not that opposite. Let me show you how to do it the wrong way! Meow. Kcirtap yeh. Edis etisoppo eht ot teg ot! Say, want to help me do some work around the house, worst enemy? Hello, Squidward! Oops. I mean, goodbye, Squidward! Aww, isn't Opposite Day... ...terrible? Wow! That's the nicest thing Squidward has ever said to me! On Opposite Day it is. I don't get it. I made my house a mess, which was making it clean, which made Squidward clean my yard, but that really means he's messing it up. But the opposite of clean is filth, which means filth is clean, that means Squidward is really making my yard a wreck, but I normally wreck my own yard which means, Squidward is being the opposite of Squidward which means he's SpongeBob! A-ha! I understand everything now! I must be the opposite of SpongeBob! By being... Squidward! Wait! It's not enough to look like Squidward to be opposite... ...you have to act like him, too. Boy, oh boy, do I like playing the clarinet. I practice and practice all day long, but I never get any better. Now you try. After you, Mr. Squidward. You're quite welcome, Mr. Squidward. Yes, please come in. Yeah, everyone says that. Positive things! Opposite Day... I'd love to. The floor creaks, the roof leaks, there's a terrible draft. Please, let me finish. The winters are harsh, the summers are brutal. There's a wild man-eating clam in the backyard! Now, would you care to see the rest of my home? Nonsense! I won't take no for an answer. Please follow me. And here's the worst room in the house. My gallery. I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Squidward. I'm Squidward, he's Squidward. Okay. I hear you loud and clear. Don't... Patrick, do you ever get the feeling that Squidward likes us too much? Aye aye sir! Welcome aboard, sir! Here at the Krusty Krab, you are the captain, and I am your cabin boy. You just say the word and I will throw myself in the brig! May I take your order? Aye-aye, sir! Monsieur's change. I've got one! A free pair of socks with every purchase! Or maybe 'Double Patty Midnight Madness'! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! I know! I know! I know! How about 'mouth full of clams' day! Everyone who shows up with a mouthful of clams... ...gets a free drink! Huh? Huh? Hoppin' clams! A talent show! I'm talented! I'd better call my folks! Hey Squidward, what time am I going on? The show! When am I going on the show? I have a great act! Ta-da! Ok, I get it. Don't worry, Squidward, I'm going to come up with the most cultured act ever! Wow! A full house! There's Mom and Dad! They are gonna be so proud! I gotta get ready! Hey, Squid! How about this for the show? The Amazing Mister Absorbency! Ta-da! Ta-da! Please, Squidward, let me be in the show! I'll do anything! Anything! Anything! Oh, yes! So, this is what it feels like... the big time! With this mop, I shape my destiny! Hey, Squidward, listen, what do you think? When I mop, should I go forward and back? No, no wait, side to side. Squidward, should I use Mr. Cleanser or Dr. Clean? Hey, Squidward, can I go on now? A-ha! Hey! Okay, that's far enough! Huh? Tartar sauce! Have you seen a Krabby Patty? It's about this tall and... Wow, a magic shop! Are you a magician? One time, I saw this magician and he did this thing...anyway, and then he told us, "If you believe in yourself and with a tiny pinch of magic, all of your dreams can come true." Plankton! It's you! Aww, cheer up, Plankton. I think you're a winner. I said, you're a-- I'll bet if he had just one friend, he wouldn't be such a meanie. Hi, Mr. Plankton. No. I mean...I want you to come out and play with me. Play with me. No, but I like to go jelly... ...fishing with my friends at Jellyfish Fields. Great! Last one to the fields is a rotten clam! So, I get the big net and you get the little net. You don't eat 'em, you catch 'em, like this! Like that. And then you throw them back. But watch out for the stingers! It's not about winning, it's about fun! Fun is when you... fun is... it's like... it's kinda... sorta like a... What is fun? Let me spell it for you. ♪F is for friends who do stuff together, U is for you and me, N is for anywhere, anytime at all!♪ Plankton! Those things aren't what fun is all about. Now, do it like this: ♪F is for friends who do stuff to-♪ Here, let me help you. ♪F is for friends who do stuff together, U is for you and me.♪ Try it! No! That's how you're suppose to feel! Okay! Who knows? Maybe he's changed. He's changed, I tell you! Plankton-buddy! Let’s go! I forgot this is a no friend zone! What's this all about, Mr. Krabs? Why can't you just accept our friendship? We've had enough of your little tests, Mr. Krabs! Come on, Plankton, let's get out of here. I sure like sequels, Plankton. Hey, Bubble Bass, you're sitting on my friend. Hey, Bubble Bass! Sure thing. Mr. Krabs? I cant believe this! What is it then? Tell me what you see here! How can you not see it!? But we sang The F.U.N. Song! I think I'm gonna be sick! How long? How long were you planning on doing this?! Tell me! What?! Really? Mr. Krabs, he's gone. He got the patty. He won. I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I thought Plankton had changed. Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs! It's time to grow myself large and wide. Not too close, Sandy. I tend to get smelly when I'm pumping iron. Check it out. All thanks to my state-of-the-art work set. Oh, really? Well, uhh, maybe I could use a little help. Wow, really? That'd be great, Sandy! I can see me now. Yeah... that would change everything! One. They're up. I'm-fee-ling-some-thing! Arm-cruncher, great. This squirrel's trying to kill me! Hey, that's great, Sandy. Well, I sure had fun, we'll have to do it again sometime, bye. This working-out thing isn't working out. Ow. Ow. Ow. Huh? Wow, now that's a good idea! I wanna be just like him. Yeah, I've gotta get to a phone! Hi, Squidward! Ahoy, Mr. Krabs! Hi, guys. Who were you expecting, Tiny Tim? Wait... wait... They're big, aren't they? Thank...You. I've been working out. Excuse me a second. Yeah. Anyone up for the... ...juice bar? I start off with twenty raw eggs everyday. But that's just me. Working out is my life! I remember when I used to look like that guy over there. I remember when I used to look like you, too. But, that was a long time ago. Thank you. Yeah... I've created my own workout routine that's given me amazing results. Whoops! Yeah, I have never felt better. What? Hmmm, well... I, uhh... first I take my hand and I do this... Do these muscles lie? Yeah, your workout routine wasn't quite tough enough for me. Uhh, what do you mean? Uhh, well, I'm not sure. Now? Wait, uhh, wait, Sandy. I don't think it's such a... Sandy, wait! Oh, no. Wait, Sandy-- don't sign just yet! Wait! Wait! Sandy, wait...! Oh, great. Thanks, Sandy. Oh, yeah. Great. No problem. Just kidding. Just kidding. 96. 97. 98. 99. 100. It hurts. 1. 2. 3. 4... ...9. 10. Can you get that? Hike, Patrick, hike! You just lost three points. One. Two. Five! G-7! But it's not Tuesday, Patrick. Now what? Okay... ready! I got it! I got it! I got it! I got it! I got it! Remember, Patrick, finders keepers. Uhh, Patrick? I think something's wrong with Squidward. He looks unconscious. Get off him, Patrick! But he still feels cold. Do you think he'll be okay? I don't know. No, no, that part goes here. We're almost there. We can do this. This is working. Patrick, this isn't working! I don't know how to say it, but our old pal Squidward, he's... He's... He's pushing up daisies! No, stay back! It was an accident! Please, Mr. Squidward's ghost! Spare us your ghostly anger! We'll do anything you want! Just have mercy on us! Does that include... Here? Here? Here? Too tired... Only the freshest, o spooky one. A grape fresh from the vine, your ghostliness. A banana peeled to your liking, your incorporealness. Art thou not pleased? Whatever you want, we'll find it. We'll find it. Flank steak. But this is just a piece of tissue paper. I can't do it! Patrick, are you ready for this? Okay, let's go. Patrick, are you coming? Patrick, it's this way. Here. It's easy. Just tear this wallpaper off! Oh, let's see. It's a comic book, and look at this. It's the Origin of the Flying Dutchman. It says when he died they used his body as a window display. Now he haunts the seven seas because he was never put to rest. Well, don't you get it, Patrick? No! We're gonna put poor old Squidward to rest. Initiation! That was part one of your ceremony. We're going to put you to rest. Yeah. Okay, get in. But you said we could put you to rest. I wrote “Here lies Squidward”. You may not remember him, but... Oh, hi, Squidward. Does this look deep enough? Oh, look, the mourners have arrived. No, just into this hole. You're bald? But- Go home. But, Master-- As you wish, master. No, Patrick, he's the fool. He's a ghost in denial. He needs us now more than ever. Patrick, say that again. No, the other thing. No, what you said before when you... Never mind. I've got an idea. I can't reach him! Isn't he beautiful? All the way, Patrick, up to the great beyond. Goodbye, friend. He's on the other side now. Mr. Krabs, what's wrong with Pearl? Oh, hi, Mr. Krabs! Are you talking to that dummy I made? It's pretty realistic isn't it? I made this part out of... Really? Oh, wow! Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I am a prom expert! Oh, Gary, I'm a prom failure. I couldn't even get a date for my own junior prom. No, that was Patrick who brought his mom. Besides, how am I supposed to compare with Pearl's old boyfriend, Mr. Long, Tan and Handsome? What is it, Gary? What do you have? Hey, Gary, this magazine gives me an idea! Long. Tan. Handsome. Okay, Gary, wait ‘til Pearl gets an eyeful of this! Uhh, Pearl, we've got to get back to the limo. Well, I guess the first thing we should do is... Uh-uh-uh... our first prom picture. Be right there. Just a second. Coming! Sorry! Pardon me! Here I am...! Cheese...! That'll be a keeper. Prom expert; away! Hi, Pearl! Come on, it won't bite! What is it? Whoa. But, I bet he isn't holder of the Regional Romance Dance Championship trophy! That just didn't happen. Let's go! Ready? The whack? Oh, yeah, I invented that one. Don't cry, the prom expert is here! I haven't failed yet! Hey, we can still... no, I broke that. We could... no. Don't cry! D-d-don't cry. Whatever you do, don't... — Messed everything up. — Hot dog! All I wanted was to have a good time! Can I still wear the wig? Let's go! Gee whiz, Pearl. I'm sorry tonight didn't go out like you planned. Ah, there you are, dummy! You sure come in handy! . Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Do you know what today is? No, silly! That's on the 15th! Today is the beginning of the judging for Employee of the Month. What do you mean? That is not true, Squidward. He gives it to me because I work harder. You could win it too, if you tried harder. Squidward, you've got it all wrong. Having pride in your work is nothing to be ashamed of, why it's the only thing that makes it all worthwhile. Huh? Nooo! How could I have let the quality of my work slip so much?! Making...Krabby Patties? Please don't tell Mr. Krabs about this! It'll hurt my chances of winning the award! That is not true, Squidward. Like this hat, that award is a symbol of... No, Squidward! An experienced employee of the month always keeps a brick of lead in his hat. What if Squidward's right? What if the award is a phony? Does this mean my whole body of work is meaningless?! But, sir… Crystal, sir! I won't let Squidward win! He can't go to work if he doesn't wake up. Target sited. You can't win that award if you don't get up for work! That can be arranged. Maybe so, but I did win 'Employee of the Month' 26 months in a row. I've been better than you 26 months--and it'll be 27 tomorrow. Well, I'm going in early to wax the floors! Well, you'll have to get up pretty early to get there before me! Well, me neither! …26-time loser! Look at him. Watchin' me. Hey, Squidward, getting sleepy, huh? Nope! Nighty Night. Hey, Squidward! Going somewhere? All right, Squidward. I'll stop by after work! Now to get some rest. Don't want to look tired for my 'Employee of the Month' photo! Squidward! Ha ha ha ha ha. Hmmm, a Krabby Patty! Ow! Squidward! Truce. You're right. We should save our energy for work where we really need it. And may the better man win. He's nothing but a lying, boneless, ink-squirting, big-nosed phony! As soon as he stops shaking my hand... Look, Mr. Krabs! Clean floors! Clean dishes, Mr. Krabs! It's much more efficient to clean dishes this way, Mr. Krabs! Look, I'm putting my own money in the register, Mr. Krabs! Two spatulas to increase productivity, Mr. Krabs! Faster, SpongeBob, faster! So, who's the winner of Employee of the Month? Huh? Who's there? Okay, Mr. Krabs, the dishes are done, I'm leaving! No thank you, Mr. Krabs. Uhh, does it have monsters in it? Uhh... no. Is it a true story? Okay, maybe just a little. Excuse me, did his ship look like a Krabby Patty? Do souls look like pickles? Humph, Squidward! The name's SquarePants. It's SquarePants! I don't get it, Gary. Every Halloween, no matter how hard I try, everybody scares me. Well, I'm sick of it. No more ScaredyPants! Gary, it's Patrick! I'm going to scare him! It's my turn. Rawr! Why can't I be frightening for once? Where's my chance? What do you think? No, no! I'm the ghost of the Flying Dutchman! I don't know, Patrick. Rawr-rawr! Okay, okay, here's your candy. I don't get it, Patrick. That is it, Patrick! What's the difference between that ghost and me? I have a square head and a real ghost has a round one. All we have to do is make my head round and boo, I'm scary! Remember, like this. Shave me down, make me round! What do you think? Oooh... I'm the Flying Dutchman! Rawr! Rawr! I'm the Flying Dutchman! Do you think? Who should we scare next? Rawr! Rawr! I'm the Flying Dutchman! Okay, Patrick, kill the lights! Help! Help! Do you mean I'm not scary? Hey, what do you know? I scared him! It worked, Patrick. I scared everybody! Pink hat? Oh, that's not a hat. That's my brain. Don't worry, it grows back! Exercise time is over, Gary. We don't want you getting too thin. Here, boy. Fetch! Huh? Good job, Gary! I love you, Gary! Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary! Ha, ha! Down, boy! Ha ha! For what? That was this weekend? I can't go; I don't have anyone to take care of Gary! Squidward, could you watch Gary this weekend? Not a Gary... Gary. He's my pet snail. Say hello! I love Gary! I guess we can't go away this weekend after all, Patrick. Actually, a three day weekend. Yeah, but you've already said you can't do it, we understand. You'll do it? Great! Let me show you a little bit about snail care. You need to take Gary for a walk... Let me show you how to feed him. The cans are all marked, a can in the morning and a can at night. Now, you won't forget my instructions, will you? Gary. See you later, Patrick. Gary! I'm home! Squidward! What are you doing here? What a great friend you are, Squidward. Thanks, Squidward. I can always count on you. Gary! Gary, what's happened to you? What's wrong? Squidward, something's wrong with Gary! Squidward! What? I knew it! Oh, Squid, did you hear that? Aren't you going to do it? Squid, wait! I can't give Gary his plasma. I'm squeamish too. Gary! Now, don't hurt him, Squidward. Okay, okay, steady. Wait, that's too hard. Okay, okay, okay, try it again. Ouch! Uh, Squidward, you just injected me with snail plasma. What's going to happen to me? I don't know, I feel kind of funny! Oh, Gary, you're better! Squidward, wait, the snail plasma! Don't worry, Gary, Squidward says I'll be fine. He knows everything. So, you hungry? Here ya go. Eat up, Gary. Sorry, Gary, I couldn't control myself. Meow. Why did I just do that? Am I cracking up? No, no, Squidward's right. I'm fine. I- I worry too much. It's all in my head. I feel tip-top! Gary, you're getting a lot faster!  Look at me. Never better. I'm okay! Squidward said I'm fine!  Gary... I'm fine!  Yyyyyy-yyyooooou'll see. That's okay, I'm a lefty anyway! Ha! Now I don't have to buy those new shoes! I take it back, Gary. Something is wrong with meeeee ow! Meow! Meow! Meow. Meow! Meow. Meow. Meow! Meow. Meow. Meow , meow , meow , meow , meow . Meow , meow , meow , meow , meow . Meow , meow , meow , meow , meow . Meow , meow , meow , meow , meow . Good morning, Squidward! Wanna go jellyfishing? Great! We'll be right over! Ready to go? No, Patrick, he's just not ready. Ready now? How about now? Now? Now? How about now? Now? Now? Now? Now? Ready yet? Sure we do. Ready? I'd love to be at work today! But it's Sunday; the Krusty Krab is closed. Well, he's not here. I'll bet that eager-beaver's already down at Jellyfish Fields! Does this mean you wanna go... Hi-yah! Oh, sorry, pineapple house. I thought you were someone else. Ah, what a great day at work. Huh? Yeah... I know you're back there, Sandy! And I also know that nobody can hide from Sponge... ...Bob. I got you now! Hi-yah! Well, I guess the coast is clear. I love this show! Hi-yah! Hi-yah! Uhh, just a second. Safety first! And now, spin technique! Double overhand squirrel knot! That'll be the day. Hey, Sandy, have you ever heard the one about the squirrel and the tin cans? Well, it goes like this! Oh, wait, I forgot the punch line. Oh, yeah! That's a good one, isn't it? What a beautiful day. Beautiful sky. Beautiful plants. Hi plants. Beautiful... pile of cans? Mmm, mmm, Sandy, that is your worst disguise yet. Sandy! Wait! Victory is yours. Yah. Curses! Oh yeah. Gotcha! What? Order up. Hi-yah! Thought you could sneak up on me at work, did ya? Well, you can't! ‘Cause I'm fast, I'm mean, and I can do this! Ssss! Took care of her, yes I did. Oh, ahoy, sir! But, sir, she snuck up on me. In my own dojo. No, sir. Just practicing my karate, sir. Or kara-tay, as some call it. Aye aye, capi-tay. Nice hairpiece, Squidward. Yes, ma'am. I mean, sir. I mean, boss. I mean, poobah! Hah! Sandy! But, Mr. Krabs. Fired? No more karate? How am I gonna tell Sandy? Sandy, wait! I can't. Mr. Krabs said I have to give up karate. No, no. Really, Sandy. Stop. No, really! Please, stop! Ahh, Mr. Krabs! But I, uhh, she... Fired? Nothing. Nothing is fun about that at all! We can? I mean, sure we can. Yeah! Like we can, uhh. We can squeeze things! Woo! How much fun was that? I know! We can act like plants. Photosynthesis. Photosynthesis. Karate sure is dumb. I feel dumb just thinking about it. Duuuuh! I'm stuuuupiiid! I like karaaateee! Doyeee! Not karate. Me, too. I don't know what anything is! In fact... For a second, that sounded like. Right now? I mean, no! What is this karate? Uhh, what do you want on your sandwich? What did you say? How many slices of barnacle loaf do you want? One for you! And one for me! Hmm? Sure thing, Sandy. Yeah? Uhh, sure. Maybe just one more. Or two! Or ten! Right! Right! Time for buns! And I'll cut the cheese! More buns! Phew. Making sandwiches sure is fun. Right, Sandy? Right? I guess I'll eat one now. In your dreams! Hi-yah! Do you think Mr. Krabs ever does karate? Mr. Krabs! Uhh, hey, Mr. Krabs, how’s it going? Nice day, huh? Oh, alright, Mr. Krabs. You caught me. But you know what? I just can't help myself. You're just gonna have to fire me. I love kara-tay! Ah, time for bed, Gary. Oh, Gary. You know what they say: curiosity salted the snail! Mind your wandering eye, you little mollusk. Sweet dreams, Gary. Hey! Over here! Wait a minute. I don't have a driver's license! Wow. My driver's license. I can't believe it! I sure take a good picture. Darn! I should have grown a mustache. How could I have forgotten the most important rule of driving? Always wear your seatbelt. Hey, I can see the Krusty Krab from here. Mrs. Puff! Look! I've finally got my driver's license! No! Ouch! Where am I? Is that me? Or is this me? Am I still dreaming? This must be Gary's dream. I'm gonna get a closer look. Whoa! Wow. Look at all these books. I wonder where Gary is. Gary! Huh? Excuse me, sir. Have you seen...? Gary? Gary! You can talk! What does that mean? Who? Gee, Gary, you sure are smart. Well, thanks for the info, Gary. I'm going back to my own dream now. I wonder what Patrick's dreaming. I can't resist! Hey, Patrick! You know, Patrick, this is a dream. You can do anything you want. I mean anything! Watch. I can turn into a skyscraper. Going up! Eh? I can make... A million of me! Eh? Eh? Ah, tartar sauce. I'm going to a different dream. Ooh, this is gonna be good! Psst! Squidward! Hey, Squidward! Squidward! Huh? Huh? Trust me, Squidward. La la! La la la la la la la!  So long, Squidward! Hey! I'm at Sandy's! Aw, this looks neat! I wonder... Hey, Sandy! What's going on? This seems kind of dangerous! Okay! Gotcha! Ouch! All right, that's it. No more messing with people's dreams. H-h-hey! Mr. Krabs. Uhh... Mr. Krabs? Oh, Pearl. This is your dream. Actually, I was looking for your dad's dream. Bye! I bet Mr. Krabs' dream will be more robust. Whatcha doin’, Mr. Krabs? What are you talking about? Look, Mr. Krabs. Pennies! This one? Wow! You look real good with a mustache, Mr. Krabs. Net ready, sir! Congratulations, Mr. Krabs. Huh? Hey! Hey! I...! This'll make a great fish story, eh, Mr. Krabs? Yes, Mr. Krabs? Ooh! Hey, Plankton's dreaming about Bikini Bottom. Plankton! This isn't a dream! This is a nightmare! Gary! Gary! No! Gary! I've got you, Gary! I think he's got the point. Ooh! Ah, that was fun and all, but it's good to be back in my own dream cloud. Ah... What do you want with me?! Leave me alone! No! No no no no no no! Hey, what are you all doing in your pajamas? Are we having a slumber party? Ah! It's raining Krabby Patties! Yeah! A quick midnight snack and then it's back to bed. Aww, sleep tight, my little angel. Ah, here it is. Nothing like a sea-nut butter and jellyfish jelly sandwich to get you to sleep. The fridge! Oh, Gary, I don't feel like myself. Don't be silly, Gary. I don't get colds. I get the suds. No, Gary. If I had the suds, I'd have bubbles coming outta me. I can't get the suds, because then I'll have to miss work! No, Gary. I like wearing my underwear like this. I'm not sick. I'm going to work. Right away, sir. Here's that patty you wanted, Mr. Krabs, sir. No, Mr. Krabs, I'm okay, honest. Oh, Gary, I feel horrible. Oh, who am I kidding, Gary? I've got the suds, no doubt about it. I'd better take care of this before it gets out of hand. Sandy, I'm sick. Can you escort me to the doctor's? Yeah, okay, Sandy, thanks. Coming. I'm sick, Patrick. I'm going to the doctor. Why not, Patrick? It can't be as horrible as the suds. Is that the horrible part, Patrick? No! No, no! No stethoscope, no doctor, no old magazines, no hiss! No! Patrick, I don't want to go to the doctor. You gotta help me get better, Patrick. Please? Would you like to be my doctor, Patrick? I don't know. No bubbles! Patrick, your treatment is working! Sure! At this rate, I'll be cured in no time. In fact, I'm going to call Sandy and tell her not to come. Thanks, Dr. Patrick! My fingers are too big for the buttons. Dr. Patrick, will you call Sandy for me? Uh-uh. Not really. I don't...think so. No. Nope. Uh-uh. Hiya, Sandy. Ahh... I'm okay, Sandy, really. I'm better, guys! Really! Guys! I can't stop now! Help me! Mr. Krabs! You're not going to make me read old magazines, are you? Whoo! Yeah! Whoo! This tickles! I can smell again! Whoo! Yeah! Yeah-eah! Whoo! Yeah! I feel as good as new! I love the doctor! Happy Valentine's Day, Bikini Bottom! Well, I'm bubbles for you, Sandy. Okay. Step one: Patrick and I get to the Valentine's Day carnival. Step two: I position Patrick and myself on top of the Ferris wheel. Step three: You arrive at designated checkpoint for maximum visual contact. Step four: Patrick is thrilled. Mission accomplished. Hi, Patrick. Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob. Patrick! Patrick... Patrick, I'm right behind you! And I have a present for you! It's the greatest... ...the bestest... ...the most fantabulous... ...present ever! But you can't have it yet. Because it's not ready yet. Not yet. Do you want to ruin the surprise? Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh! Hmmm...nope, sorry. No can do! You'll just have to wait! Okay, Patrick, here we are It's not the carnival. Here, why don't you take this quarter and... It's not the quarter. Now, take that quarter and buy some cotton candy... Ten-four, Sandy, SpongeBob here. Ohh, not yet, Sandy. Patrick's still trying to guess what his Valentine is. You'll have to guess! No. No. Nope. Are you sure? SpongeBob to Sandy, you can bring it in now. Late? But what about... ...Patrick? If Patrick doesn't get his valentine... Patrick! Uhh, actually it's on the Ferris... Well, this is where you're gonna get it...I hope. Just keep looking out there, pal. SpongeBob to Sandy, SpongeBob to Sandy, come in, Sandy! No, no, B, Sandy! No, B! Uh, Patrick, you know how sometimes you plan something special and things don't just work out? Patrick, here it is! It's a handshake...a friendly handshake. A friendly handshake. Happy Valentine's Day! Uh, no problem, Fran. You too, Dave. Patrick!  Okay, Patrick, I know I deserve this. But, do they? Yeah! Sandy's here! Woo-hoo! Look Patrick, it's here! It's here! The best valentine in the whole wide world is right behind you! I'm telling you, it's right there, turn around! Patrick, just turn around! Happy Valentine's Day, Patrick! Patrick, no! Squidward! Squidward! Squidward, wait! You dropped this little piece of paper. I just figured you probably want it back. Garbage?! But, Squidward, in the right hands, this paper is a gold mine of entertainment. A spectacular afternoon of underwater fun. A treasure trove of... So you don't want it? Does that mean I can have it? You sure? So are you definitely, positively sure? But are you... Last chance to change your mind, Squidward. So, I take that as a possible no? Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Okay, Squidward, that's a promise I'll just have to keep. Ah, Mr. Paper, I am so lucky to have a friend like Squidward. I'm sorry, Squidward, it's just... ...it's just that I'm thinking of all the fun I'm going to have with this piece of paper! La, la, la, la, la. Gary, watch this! Guess what I am. Well, yes, Gary, I am a sponge with paper stuck in his pants, but I'm also... Super Sponge, soaking up crime. See, here's my cape. Now I'm... SpongeBob JunglePants! Ugh. SpongeBob JunglePants summon animal friends. You're right, Gary. I'm not a jungle boy. I'm a box of army supplies, bringing relief to the hungry troops! Landing just in time for the bullfight! Toro, toro, Gary! Toro, toro! Toro, Gary, toro... Hey, ole! Now for some impressions. A guy with a mustache. Look at me, I'm a guy with a mustache. A pirate with an eye patch. Arrgh, I'm a pirate. A regular guy with an eye patch. Arrgh, I am not a pirate. Look, Gary, oral-gami. Isn't this great? La-la-la-la-la... La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la... Oh, that's a good one, Squidward, now let me try. Have you heard any good jokes, Mr. Paper? I don't know, what happened to the paper that fell in the ocean? La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la... Nope. Hooray! Hooray! That was great, Squidward. All those wrong notes you played made it sound more original. Yeah, see, you're playing it like this... ...when ordinarily it goes like this... I'm partial to doing it in the key of A-minor myself. Ah, nothing like a duet between buddies, eh, Squidward? I can't! I can't! You made me promise no matter how much you begged, and pleaded, and cried not to give the paper back to you ever. Sure you did, Squidward, look. Wanna see it again? Sorry, Squidward, I am sworn to a promise. Maybe I should get going. Wow, pocket lint! You drive a hard bargain, Squidward. Paper for lint, hmmm... The rubber band? Do I dare? Okay... Oh, I get it. You're just testing me. Don't worry, Squidward, I won't let you down. A promise is a promise. Squidward? Hey, listen... Oh, Squidward, is this still part of the test? Because it's...it's really getting harder and harder to keep my promise. Squidward's shirt. I've always loved that shirt. Okay, okay, I'll trade! I can break a promise for this. Squidward, do you want your other stuff, ‘cause this is all I'll need? Yippee! I'm rich! Look, Patrick, eight gold doubloons! Boy, Mr. Krabs, you sure are sweaty. There are no real doubloons, Mr. Krabs! It's a game: "The Flying Dutchman's Treasure Hunt". Take a break and play around with us. I cleaned the tables, Mr. Krabs! I already took care of it. My turn. One, two, three, four. Look for the Deacon's Goose thru the fork in the old tree and head that way. Well, I see Mr. Krabs' zipper is undone. Just kidding, Mr. Krabs. I'm almost to the treasure. Your turn again, Mr. Krabs. You are a real pirate. Go straight to the "X" that marks the spot. You get to dig for treasure, Mr. Krabs! Hey, Mr. Krabs is getting all sweaty again. I think we ought to call it a night, Mr. Krabs. I really got to get some sleep. I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. See you tomorrow. Huh? Who's there? Mr. Krabs, it's late. Go to bed! Good night, Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs, you gotta... But, Mr. Krabs... But, Mr... But, Mr... MR. KRABS!!! I WANNA GO TO BED!!!!! Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry, but it's just a game, ya know? Aw, go home already. I'm done playing that game, Mr. Krabs. Pirates? Oh, Patrick. Look! Peg legs and eye patches. Look, I'm Peggy the Pirate! Ow. Really? Can we see the map? Okie dokie, then. Okie... oops. I mean... arrgh! Captain Krabs. Captain, we're about to hit... uhh... I mean... arrgh, Capt., arrgh, we're, arrgh, about, arrgh, to hit, arrgh... The whole ship is underwater captain. But, Mr. Krabs, that seaweed has... Which way, captain? Mr. Krabs, we're tired. Yeah, we'll be your loyal crew. I'm so loyal, I don't even mind sleeping on the cold, hard ground while Captain Krabs sleeps in his warm, dry tent. But we've only been gone a few hours. I'm so loyal, I don't wanna sleep till we find the treasure. Let's go see if the captain will go now! He's not here. Only the captain can look at the map, Patrick. Patrick, what are you doing? Patrick, you're not supposed to look at the map. No, guess there isn't. Oops! Patrick, it opened by itself. Yeah? You mean, like that it's our game board taped to a piece of paper? Not at all, Captain Krabs. We don't think that at all! Look! It's the "X". Wow! That game really is based on a real treasure map. We got it, Captain Krabs. What are you going to do with your share, Patrick? We found it together. So we deserve a share! What about loyalty? And one for all. And one for all. And one for all. And one for all. Wow! Another funtastic day at Glove World! Let me get my wallet. Wait, let me check this pocket. No... Patrick, do you have any change? How much is it? Fifty cents. Lemme check my other poc- What did you say? Thanks, mister. Okay! Here's my glove light. I see you! Cool! Yeah, Patrick? Where did you see that? What? Patrick, I think we're on the wrong... ...buuuuuuuuuuus!.... ...bus! But, sir, we need to get back to Bikini Bottom. Rock Bottom. It sure is weird around here. Kinda different, even the soil looks different. Uhh, that's an easy one, Patrick. We just wait for somebody to come out and then you'll know. Maybe we should wait for one more. Uhh, uhh, okay. You wait for the bus. Call me when it comes and I'm gonna get a bus schedule. Boy, this place sure is creepy. I guess Grandpa SquarePants was right. Don't run for a bus. Especially one that's going up at a 90-degree angle. I better go wait for the next one. C'mon, bus. I've got to get home and feed Gary. Uh-oh, shoe's untied. Over, under, and over, and loop-dee-loop, and over... and through the hole. My balloon! Wait! Hold on! Stop that bus! Aww, not again! Umm, excuse me, sir. Can you help me? Uhh, uhh, yeah, I... No, no! Not the balloon! I need to know what time the next bus comes... Well, there goes another one. I gotta be more diligent. I am not leaving this spot, no matter what. I'm gettin' hungry. Glove candy dispenser. Good thing I went to Glove World!. Eww, glove flavored! Hey, what's that? A candy machine. Mmm, kelp nougat crunch. Mmm... I'm not leaving this spot, no matter what! I'll only be gone a second. Hey! Ooh! Come on, come on! Hey, that was mine! Barnacles! Alright, that's it. No more mister nice guy. Tartar sauce! Fish paste! I'm getting to the bottom of this, right now! I want a bus to Bikini Bottom. I am first in line and no one is going to tell me, otherwise! Okay, second. I am second in line. Okay, third is good. Fourth, not bad. Okay, 329. I am 329th in line and nobody forget it. Well, at least the line is moving. Tartar sauce! Finally! Yes, I'm next! When is the next bus to Bikini Bottom? The bus schedule. The next bus. The next bus... to Bikini... Bottom. Oh, no... you don't! Hold it, I'm not through here! Do you hear me? I demand you come back and give me a bus to Bikini Bottom, right now. And until then, I am not leaving this spot! Okay, like I said, I'll be right here when you get back. At this spot. In the dark. By myself. With no one around. Except my glove light! Ah, that's better. This isn't your average everyday darkness. This is... advanced darkness. Hey... if I close my eyes, it doesn't seem so dark. Who's there? Well, I guess that spot will be there tomorrow. I better just keep walking. Running! Better start running! Running! Sprinting! I just gotta keep sprinting! Sitting, sitting. Bleeding. Hey, who's there? Okay, that's enough. Don't come closer. I'm warning you! I'm a sponge! Oh, it's only you. Well, that solves my balloon problem, but I have a bigger problem. I'm kinda stuck here. I need to catch a bus to get home. You don't understand a word I'm saying, do you? Balloon... has... enough... air... thanks. Hey, I get it, balloon travel. Thank... you! Ah, home at last. Good morning, Bikini Bottom! Ahh, what a beautiful day! I wonder if Patrick's at home. Goin' over to Sandy's place. Hey, what's this? This doesn't look like Sandy's place. What is it? Texas? What's a Texas? All right then. Let's make one of your treedome. Sandy? Hi-yah! Oh-ho. I get it. Not feeling up to karate, huh? Whatever you say, Sandy. Boy, I hope Sandy doesn't attack me from me from behind. Hi-yah! Uhh, Sandy? Surf's up, Sandy! Boy, there's nothing like going jellyfishing! Look, Sandy, we caught one! We don't eat 'em! We let 'em go! Go on, go back to where you belong. Run along, back to your family and friends. I know they miss you as much as you miss them. Hurry, before they forget you and leave you behind. Remember: there's no place like home! Sandy, what the heck are you crying about? Sandy... Homesick, huh? Almost there. Da-ta-dah. Sandy? I don't get it, Patrick! What's wrong with Sandy? Patrick, do you hear that? Wait, Patrick, listen. It's Sandy. Patrick, she sang that song from her heart. She really misses Texas. Patrick, we can't...that's it! Patrick, your genius is showing! Everything looks perfect. We're going to get Sandy now. Shh! Don't spoil the surprise! You want to come with us to the Krusty Krab? What are you doing with those bags? What?! Now?! You can't! I mean we... Wait, Sandy! You can't! Uhh, we we're gonna...the...the...Krusty Krab...that is not the right direction! Wait, if you don't...if I can't...augh! Sandy! Wait a second! You don't wanna leave without having one last Krabby Patty down at the Krusty Krab? But, Sandy, don't you want to say goodbye to all your friends down at the Krusty Krab? No, no! Wait! Sandy! I can't believe she's gone. You mean we can't say anything bad about dumb ol' Texas? Oh, so you mean we can't say anything bad about... Texas! Look, Patrick, I'm Texas! Duh, howdy, y'all! Howdy y'all! Howdy y'all! The stars at night are dull and dim, whenever they have to be over dumb ol' stupid Texas! Hey, Patrick, what am I now? No, I'm Texas! You'll have to catch us first! We did it! We got her! Okay, Patrick, that's enough. Run faster, Patrick! No! Almost there! Sandy, no! It's a party! It's your own little slice of Texas! Check it out, Sandy! We got square dancing... ...giant Barbecues... ...homemade peas-in-a-can pie... ...and we got our very own 10 gallon hats! So, what do ya think? Are you gonna stay? Don't cry anymore, Sandy, I'll go get your bags. Does that mean you'll stay? That makes me feel all wiggly. Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! I'll have one... One, please. One, please. Aww, barnacles. Plankton, what are you doing here? And why are you crying? I'll eat one of those ice cream cones for ya. Sure! Yeah? Training? Assertive, huh? Anything I want. Sounds great! Umm, excuse me, sir, you're sitting on my body, which is also my face. Beep Beep! But I'm a spo... Ice cream! That's my ice cream cone! You can have it. Hey, that guy was crying! Yeah! Uhh, I thought it was called assertive. Well, if it got me this ice cream, then I like it! I found something! Sure! Do you want to take a hike with me? Hey, go check in that ditch! Did you see that, Plankton? That guy found some buried treasure! Hey! I'm gonna tie your shoe if you don't give that back! Okay, never mind! It's alright, Plankton, he's wearing sandals. What's the matter? No it's not! But what about airline food? Airline food. My gosh, what is up with that stuff? Thank you, good night! See, I can be a stand-up guy. See? Wait, Plankton, give me another chance! Just watch me! Man, this thing is sandy! Well, not all of me. I'll do better than that! What? Plankton, did you see that? I was a regular alpha-male! Plankton? Plankton, all my asserting is driving everybody away! You didn't tell me everyone would leave. Mega Bucket?! You used me... for land development! That wasn't nice! Well, what about aggressively nice people? What happened? No problem! Gee, Plankton, I'm sorry about the Chum Bucket. Volleyball, anyone? Serve up! Aaa! Ouch! Aaa! Ouch! Aaa! Ouch! Wake up, Gary. We're moving today! That's right! We're leaving home. We're going to become peasants! No more food. Sorry, Gary. Peasants only eat mashed-up clamshells. April Fools! There ya go, pal! Whew, I'm thirsty! This is an extreme thirst! Whew, I'm exhausted. I sure can't wait to drink all of these drinks! April Fools! To me! Yeah, but he told us to tell you... He told me to tell you... April Fools. Squidward, wait! Wait, Squidward! It was just a joke! No more jokes on you today, I promise! Sure, there are lots of other willing participants. Right, Mr. Krabs? They're right here, lady! April Fools! Welcome to the Krusty Krab. How may I help you? Hey, what's that? April Fools! I'm right here! Sure! A couple of ice cubes coming up! Here you go. April Fools! I... I... You asked for a couple of ice cubes in your drink, and I only put in one! Hey, your shoes untied. April Fools! You're not wearing shoes! April Fools! Oh, boy! Something for me to clean up! Whooaahh! Whoa! Blblblblblblblblblblblbl... Whoooooooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! What do you want? What? What? I can't. I don't have a bottle opener. But I couldn't... Squidward! Is all that true? Even the part about the lima beans and the car chase? I promise. What would we do without Squidward? Behold the ultimate cooking utensil, the golden spatula! Only a fry cook worthy of King Neptune himself can wield... Oh, oh, oh, oh! Take a picture of me and the spatula! Okay, I'm ready! Menu section? That's easy, it's over that way. Uh-oh. Uhh, Patrick... Uhh, I did, Mr. Neptune, sir. SpongeBob SquarePants. But, but... Like? Actually, I've got two. Patrick! You hurt my friend! You're not a king, you're a bully and a liar! I will accept your challenge if you fix my friend. How you feeling? I'm ready. May the best man win. I'm not good enough to cook in Atlantis, Patrick. I should have never taken the challenge. Once upon a time... Perfect! So, uhh, what do you think? What's so funny? You mean, Patrick can't come? And my friends? I know, Mr. Krabs, I'll miss you, too. I... I... I don't wanna go! Wait, Neptune! I have another idea! Hi, Patrick. What'll you have? Can you excuse me? What did I tell you about using your powers, trainee? Almost. There's a nasty barnacle under table nine. Warn him about what, Mr. Krabs? The hooks? What could be worse than that? Don't let 'em get me, Mr. Krabs. Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs. Hey, Patrick. I can't leave now. I'm working. Where is everybody? Doesn't look like any carnival I ever... Excuse me. Stop, Patrick! Don't touch it! This isn't the carnival, Patrick. Those are hooks. Mr. Krabs says they're really dangerous! All I know is Mr. Krabs said-- Patrick, don't do that! But, Mr. Krabs said... Patrick, don't! Patrick! Help! Oh, Patrick, help! Oh, Patrick, come back. Oh, my best friend. Patrick, you're alive. But...what about the surface, and your britches, and the gift shops? Mr. Krabs said I shouldn't get near those things. Well, no. I guess he didn't. Ready? This is more fun than double overtime at the Krusty Krab. Again! I...I...I... Gift shop? Okay, Gary. Today is a new day. I'm ready to prove myself loyal to Mr. Krabs. I'm ready! I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready, ready, ready. I'm ready. I always go to work this way. But, Patrick, we promised. You don't have any fingers, Patrick. But Mr. Krabs said... Umm... Ooh, I know I want to, but I promised Mr. Krabs I wouldn't go near another... ...hook! Oh no! Mr. Krabs told me all about you. You are a liar! A deceiver! I'll never fall for your tricks again! Never! Is this seat taken? Whew! Glad I got that out of my system. I'm...hooked! And that means... Help! I'm hooked! Help! Mr. Krabs! Help! It happened! I'm hooked! Oh, no! The hook! The hook! Gift shop, tuna can, mayonnaise! Psst, Mr. Krabs. Um, you know those hooks we were talking about yesterday? Umm...no. I mean yes, yes, you told me not to go near them. Of course not. I mean, not exactly. I mean yes! Yes I did it! I admit it! Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'm so ashamed! I mean, look at me! I'm hooked! What am I gonna do? Oh no, Mr. Krabs. I can't take off my pants. Not in front of all these girls. D’oh, okay. I'm taking em off. I'm taking 'em off. There. Oh no. Oh no, no, no, Mr. Krabs. I can't do it! Anything but that! Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'll listen! I promise. Please save me, Mr. Krabs! I promise I'll be good! Whew. The pants! The underwear! I'm ready! I'm ready! Aw. I worked forever on those life-size Krabby Patty mannequins of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Hey! SpringBoob SquirePin stole my idea! Whahoo! Oh, I wonder when my prize will... get here... My prize! Can it be? It is. The conch signal. From The Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. As seen on TV. I wonder if it still works. Hmm. Maybe the conch signal doesn't work anymore. I can't believe it, Gary. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in our home. Excuse me, I'm... Oh, that was me. I blew the conch signal, sir. Don't worry. There's no danger. I won it in a contest. Yes, sirs! Don't worry, Mermaid Man. You won't be hearing from me for just anything. Only for the big emergencies. Help... Can't... open mayonnaise. But... I'm sorry, Barnacle Boy. I didn't mean it. I... just wanted to spend time with you. You're my heroes! Oh... Hey, can I drive? Tons! Like the windshield wipers are right here. Hey! I've got the doughnuts! You're under arrest, Atomic Flounder. But you said he could snap... ...just like that. I can't believe it: I rode in the Invisible Boatmobile, met a villain, and learned to treat third-degree burns, all in one day. So, what are we going to do tomorrow. Okay. It doesn't seem to be here. Aye, aye, sir. Aw, that's the 15th time I've looked. But I can't let my heroes down. I found it and it's the special dance mix! Holy Krabby Patties! Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's arch nemesis: The Dirty Bubble! I can't believe it! You don't understand! You're my most favorite super villain. Can I get your autograph? I am? Oh... Gary! Uh, uh, I was just looking for the sports channel, Gary. Come in! Wow! Those are great, Patrick! Let's see what they look like on your feet. Okay... And we can wear gloves on our feet and hats on our captain's quarters, too. Do you know how lucky you are to have a friend like me? Look at this knot. Have you ever seen a more perfectly executed shoe-fastening bow? I learned when I was just a boy, Patrick, and I'm willing to pass on what I know. Go sit over there and let an old pro show you how to do it. Pay close attention, Patrick. Well, you start by taking one lace per hand... And then you... Uh, you gotta... Loop the, the... Patrick, please, shoe-tying requires peace and quiet. Okay, where was I? Well, I guess you don't want me to show you how to do it. I've got it! The first rule of shoe-tying is always start with your right foot. Now the lesson will officially begin. That's... "knot" right. Get it? Knot... right... hmm... Okay, no more fooling around. I've got it! Patrick, aren't you late for something? I can't believe I've forgotten how to tie my own shoes. They've been tied as long as I can remember. Well, I'll remember after a good night's sleep. Oh... No big deal. I'll remember sooner or later. 'Cause I'm ready! I'm... read... ...y! I'm read... ...Ooh! I'm read... ... Uh! I'm read... ...Ooy! I'm read... Doy! I'm read... Doy! I'm read... Uh! I'm read... Doy! I'm read... Doy! I'm read... Duh! Oh, no! I can't let Patrick see I still haven't tied my shoes. Well, a sponge has to look his spongiest. Well, I've gotta get to work. Oh, barnacles! Maybe I should just lay here. He's right! Got to make... Krabby Patties! Laces or no laces! Ah... I just have to stand in this one spot. Ta-da! A perfect patty. Hey, Squidward, I've got an idea! How about you come get it? No! Okay, Squidward. Here I come. I'm coming over. I'm bringing the patty to you. Here comes the patty. No problem. I'm walking...the Krabby Patty...over to Squidward. All right, Squidward. I'm giving you the patty... For the hungry customer... So they can eat it... When I give it to you... Which is right... now. Okay, Squidward. Just slowly move your leg. Walk over there... with the... Dah! I'm sorry, Squidward. I'll just make another... Doh! Hold it... Doy! Let me just... Doy! I've failed. My career is over. I'm sorry, spatula. I'm sorry, hat. I'm sorry, floor. I am sorry, Krabby Patties. I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs, it's just that I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I forgot how to tie my shoes. So you'll show me how? Could you show me how to tie my shoes? Could you show me how to tie my shoes? Could any of you show me how to tie my laces? Could you, you, you, you, or you show me how to tie a knot? Could you show me how to tie a simple knot? Could you show me how to tie my shoes? Could you show me how to tie my shoes? Doesn't anybody know how to tie a knot?! I did. Yes, please, Mr. Flying Dutchman, sir. Hooray! Ooh... Ooh... Those are great, Mr. Flying Dutchman, sir. Now can you show me how to tie my shoes? Not now, Gary. I'm not in the mood, Gary. Just leave me and me untied shoes alone, Gary Okay, Gary, you have my attention. Gary! Well, I'll be! You can tie shoes! Hoppin' clams! How did you learn to do that? I was just testing it. One Krabby Patty coming up! What's wrong, Mr. Krabs? You've gotta let go of the dime. Oh no, not again! Ahh! Really? The cash register... Wow! Squidward, who's gonna work the grill? Ah... This is the best day of my life. But wait, if I'm running the register and the grill, what are you gonna do? Squidward! You forgot to teach me how to use... The cash register. I can't believe this is really happening. Today, I start living! Hi, Squidward. All done with those errands? Do you want four quarters? Or ten dimes? Or twenty nickels? Or one hundred pennies? Or one quarter, three dimes, seven nickels, and ten pennies? Or, if you give me a five dollar bill, your options are... May I help you, sir? Oh, hi, Squidward! How are those errands going? Well, I'm sure you are. I'm sure you are. How's that? Aye-aye, Mr. Tentacles. Boy, no wonder Mr. Krabs put him in charge. Have you finished...? Have you finished those errands? Have you finished those errands? Have you finished those errands? Have you finished those errands? Have you finished those errands? Have you finished those errands? Have you finished those errands? But I haven't... Gosh, Squidward sure is a hard worker. He makes me proud to wear these hats. Hi, Squidward. Are you finished with those errands yet? Uh, does that mean you're...? Then you might wanna put these on. Hmm... Hey, Squidward, you know what? Look! We forgot to switch the "Closed" sign to "Open". . It's almost like we could've taken the whole day off! Wow, it's Sunday, Gary! Guess what's for breakfast? That's right! A sundae! Whoops... Looks like we're out of ice cream. Guess I'll have to use something else... Ketchup! Hmmm... Bananas... Cherries... Boring. Ah, here we go! Onions! Ready, Gary? Just one more thing! Pea... ...nuts. Gary! Our peanuts jar is totally empty! Hmmm... Wait! I know one other place we can find peanuts. Good thing I still have these peanut plants growing in the windowsill. A little texture never hurt. There we go. This sundae's gonna taste great! Aren't you going to help me, Gary? Gary? Oh, well. More for me! You know what they say, Gary. I'm easy like Sunday morning. Okay, let's see my to-do list. Go to work, go to work, go to work, go to work, go to work.. Wait, that's not right. I need the one for Sunday. Ah, here we go. 'Say hi to everyone in Bikini Bottom'. Hello. Some people are even late on Sunday. Hi, Mailfish? Hi, Mrs. Crossing Guard! Wow! A parade! Hi, parade! Hi, tuba player, hi, drummer, hi, guy with the cymbals, hi, trumpeter, hi tambourine girl, hi, timbale man, hi, didgeridoo player, hi, triangle player, hi, guy with the kettle drum, hi, pianist, hi, guy with the flute. And heeelllooo, Dolly! Was it something I said? Something weird is going on today. Everyone is running away from me. And now... ...giant piles of bubble gum?! Oh, what next? Oh, hi, Patrick. I'm confused. Patrick, everyone is running away from me. Watch. Hi, building! I just don't get it. Good one, Patrick. Ugly? You gotta be kiddin' me.. Hi. Oh no! I can't be ugly! I can't be! I can't be ugly! Am I ugly? Am I ugly? Oof I'm ugly... Go. Run away like all the others. No one would want a friend as ugly as I am. That didn't help at all. How long? How long have I been ugly, Patrick? Help me! I'm so ashamed! I'm spiraling! I'm spiraling! Thanks, Patrick. It's okay, Patrick. Spiraling, over. I can't. I know, Patrick. I'm ugly. Square? I'm ugly and I'm proud. I'm ugly and I'm proud. I'm ugly and I'm proud. I'm ugly and I'm proud! I'm ugly and I'm proud! I'm ugly and I'm proud! That felt great! I feel empowered. I don't know. How about a movie? Pardon me. Ugly sponge coming through. Hi. I am very ugly. But you should enjoy the movie anyway. Excuse me, sir. I hope my horrible ugliness won't be a distraction to you. I can't do this, Patrick! I've tried, and I've tried, but I'm not always as confident as I look. Maybe I'd better just go back and hide. Hello. Hi. They all ran away, Patrick. Oh, wait, Patrick! I just remembered. I've got some of my peanut-onion sundae we can share! Patrick, is everything okay in here? What are you doing in there, Patrick? And why is that bag on your head? Just remember what we talked about. There's power in pride. Patrick...? Patrick? Patrick! You're not ugly. Your breath stinks. Really bad. Arrgh, barnacles, Patrick! What did you eat?! No, I mean just this morning. What else? Sundae... Patrick! My sundae gave us rancid breath! I mean, we're not ugly, we just stink! Oh, guess what, Squidward? Woo! Hooray! The new spatulas are here! No new spatulas? Right! Okey-dokey, Squidward. And then we'll get those new spatulas! Hello, pole. What's in the box? I like surprises. I'm ready! Okay, Squidward. Pearl... this is the greatest uniform ever! Sorry, Pearl, but this item's not on the menu! A stick in the sand. Me? Really? Well, I have been trying to get Mr. Krabs to make a few changes around here. I got it! How about The Khaotic Krab? The King Krab? The Kool Krab. Or the Kowboy Krab! The Kurly Krab. The Kreepy Krab. The Killer Krab! You're right, too scary. Pearl, you're a genius. All these young, hip new customers. Phooey on Squidward. He can't keep up with the times. You're a true visionary, Pearl. Well, hip people have to eat, too. Back to the grill. The customers may be hot, but my grill is hotter. Two... sa-lads. Never heard of it. I got to stay hip. I don't want to end up like silly old Squidward. But what in the name of Davy Jones' locker is a sa-lad? Here you go. Two sa-lads. But that just leaves the lettuce and the tomato. All right. Okay, no buns. That's hip. No patties, happenin.' Oh, yeah, that's definitely the coolest meal I've ever saw. Two salads. That was awful. I hope I never have to tear apart a perfectly good Krabby Patty ever again. I don't think my heart can take it. Where's the grill? Uh... right on. Salad and tea. But where are the Krabby Patties? This is humiliating. I'm a fry cook, darn it! You can take away my spatula, but when you take away my dignity, that's when I get mad! I'm going to march right up to Mr. Krabs' office and tell him this is just too much! Okay, SpongeBob, you can do this. Come on... Mr. Krabs, can I talk to you? Thanks, Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs, um, I think we have a problem. Sure, Mr. Krabs, but I've got some bad news. Mr. Krabs, Pearl is ruining the Krusty Krab! There, there, Mr. Krabs. I'm sure there's another way. What's it? That's not what I said, sir. Pearl, can I see to you in the kitchen for a second? How am I going to break it to her? I've never fired anyone before. I just got to say it. Pearl, you're fired! Okay, here it goes. Sure it is, Pearl. Look at all the hip, young people eating sa-lads! I got it! I can pretend to "fire you." I'll take the heat from old man Krabs later. Stop trying to break me in half? Okay, Pearl. We've got to make this convincing. Pearl, I need to have a word with you! It's not that you haven't done a good job around here, it's just that... Well, we feel it might be in everybody's best interest if... Pearl, you're fired. Hey, Mr. Krabs, I did it! There, there, Mr. Krabs. Pearl took it just fine, in fact, she seemed sort of happy. She's off to bigger and better things. Isn't this great, Gary? And it only cost me one year's salary! Hold still, Gary. Almost done. That's great, Patrick. What's it for? "For Outstanding Achievement In Achievement: SpongeBob SquarePants?" Patrick, I think the award is for me. You must've got it by mistake. Yeah, but you know what else is shiny? Exactly! No, don't! That's my... ...award closet. Aww, Patrick, don't cry. You'll get an award one day. But you're Patrick... Star. You can do anything you want. Patrick, if you wanna win an award, you have to do something. Me too! But that sounds a little hard. Why don't we start smaller? Smaller. Smaller. The smallest you can think of. Yeah! I do things at work all the time. And at 50 dollars an hour, too. When I started working here, I had to pay Mr. Krabs 100 dollars an hour. Hey, Squidward, guess who just got a job? You have to work for it, remember? Pick up order! No, you have to take the tray to the customer. Almost. Try again and this time make sure the food gets to the table. Nope. Let's try something different. All you have to do is answer the phone. Uhh, Patrick, that's the name of the restaurant. It looks a little dusty around Table 3. How about you sweep it out? You'll do fine. Keep trying, Patrick. Kitchen! Don't give up, Patrick. This time I've got something I know you can do. We're gonna open a jar. Easy. Now you try. First get a jar. Patrick, that's a pickle. You need a jar. No. No. No. Try...this! Now take the lid off the jar. Just relax. Lift your hand. Great! We're almost there. Now put it on the lid. No, the lid. Freeze! Almost there. Now head for the lid. Cold. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. You're hot. You're on fire! You need a jar. No. No. No. Try...this! Now take the lid off the jar. Just relax. Lift your hand. Great! We're almost there. Now put it on the lid. No, the lid. Freeze! Almost there. Now head for the lid. Cold. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. You're hot. You're on fire! You need a jar. No. No. No. Try...this! Now take the lid off the jar. Just relax. Lift your hand. Great! We're almost there. Now put it on the lid. No, the lid. Freeze! Almost there. Now head for the lid. Cold. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. You're hot. You're on fire! Ok, ok. Wait, wait. Do exactly as I do. Exactly as I do. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. No, no, Patrick, you did it! That was great, Patrick! You really got the hang of it. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Patrick, you do exactly what I do and you'll have an award in no time. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. Wow. It's amazing how a simple change of clothes can make a guy look...just...like...me. That's creepy...but flattering! I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready... Huh? Well, back to the ol' grind. Forget my hat.  Dropped my spatula. Aha! You're copying me! Why are you doing that? Well, it's annoying, so stop it! Say, you're good. At least I'm safe inside my mind. Stop copying me! Patrick, how long are you gonna keep this up? We'll see about that! I'm the jump-rope champion of Bikini Bottom. Oh, yeah? I call this one: The Slice N' Dice. Ha! Not a scratch on me. Not much fun being me, now, huh, Patrick? I wish I had the old Patrick back, but he just wants to be like me. Hi, I'm Patrick Star. I'm the laziest, pinkest starfish in Bikini Bottom and I wish I were me and not SpongeBob. But, Patrick... Another trophy? 'For Doing Absolutely Nothing Longer Than Anyone Else'. Patrick! This trophy's for you! So, what are you gonna do, now? Hey everybody! It's Leif Ericcson Day! Hinga-dinga-durgin! Ahoy, Patrick! It's Leif Ericcson Day! There's a note. Aww... so much for that. Maybe Sandy will play with me. Another note. I don't get it. The water's fine. Hey, Squidward! Want to play? Are you sure? Darn. I wish I had a buddy to play with. I know! I'll make one! Stick Buddy! Nah... Rock Buddy! Nope... Sink Buddy! "" Almost... I've got it! Bubble Buddy! This...is...great! I can't wait for you to meet Squidward and Mr. Krabs. Don't be shy, come on! Hi, Squidward! I want you to meet my new friend, Bubble Buddy! Oh, I'm not hungry. Wait! You haven't taken Bubble Buddy's order yet! He's hungry. Wait, Bubble Buddy. Let me decide for you. Hmmm. Krabby Patty, Double Patty Patty, Krabby Junior Junior, Jumbo Small Patty, Junior Senior Sophomore Patty, Quarter Ouncer Double Pounder...ohh, it's all so good! He'll just have one of everything. Bubble Buddy's thirsty. Sounds great! Uhh, Bubble Buddy likes bendy straws. Huh, what's that? Bubble Buddy says it tastes funny. What do you think? Oh no, Squidward, wait! There's cheese on these patties! Bubble Buddy's lactose-intolerant, he can't eat cheese! What should we do? Don't worry, Bubble Buddy. Squidward will make a fresh batch. Actually he doesn't like the crust. And Squidward, the ketchup should be under the patty. And Squidward, the pickles should be on the left side. And Squidward, you should... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward... That was delicious! Money's on the table, Mr. Krabs! Here we are, Bubble Buddy, Goo Lagoon. There are lots of ways to have fun here. See what I mean? All done! Bubble Buddy, you dig him out while I get some cotton candy. My friend's in there. Woo! Shake it! Shake it! Yeah! Shake that bubble butt! Yeah! Hey, Pearl! Shake hands with Bubble Buddy! It's his first time on his own. Hey, Bubble Buddy, you're finished! Hey, everyone! Have you met my friend, Bubble Buddy? Hey, is this one of those sewing circles? Would you mind not getting so close with those pins? Pointy objects make Bubble Buddy uncomfortable. Oh no, he already took care of that, but thanks for your concern. Why?! No! I won't let you! Here we go! You'll never catch us now! Never! Ha haa! Never! Never... No! You can't! He's not just a bubble, he's a Bubble Buddy! He's my friend and I love him! Haven't you ever had a very special friend? So, what do you say? Noo... So long. Of course! Otherwise he couldn't tell such funny jokes! Seems like only this morning I held his bottle. They blow up so fast. Order up, Squidward! Hey, hey Squidward, did you see me? Okay, see you later, Squidinator. Squidward, in honor of employee brotherhood, I present to you a gift. Ta-dah. I wasn't sure how big to make the hole for the head, so I used a watermelon for size. Do you love it? Eyelashes! Is this any better, Squidward? I made this one with my tears. Mr. Krabs, are you okay? I heard a... wow! A pie! It's from Squidward. "To SpongeBob... Well, here you go." Hey guys. Thanks for the pie, Squidward. La, la, lalalalalala. Here's your order, sir. Yes? Part two? Part two, part two, part two, part two... What's the part two? Actually, I keep a list of the fun things I like to do. I call it my friendship list. The things that are extra fun, I've written in red. Yeah, I know. Then let's roll! Bye, Mr. Krabs. Heads up, Squidward—looks like they're gonna replace you. Well, the first thing I want to do is show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town. Hi, there, this is my best friend, Squidward. Hey, kids, check it out! This is my best friend, Squidward. Hi, I want to show you my best friend, Squidward. Good, 'cause we're onto our next activity. I'm gonna show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town wearing a salmon suit. That's a good one Squidward! Next. Knock-knock jokes! Hey Squid, knock-knock. I am! Look out, everyone, friends in reverse! Turn left, and... stop. See, that's what it would be like if you had me for a face. Who's the doctor here? The last thing on the list is... Watch the sunset with Squidward. Hey, it's Mr. Krabs! Hi, Mr. Krabs. Okay, see you later. Ah, underwater sunsets sure are beautiful. Eh, Squidward? Yeah, this is great, just the three of us. You, me, ...and this brick wall that you built between us. Sunsets always remind me of bowls of fruit. What do they make you think of, Squidward? You know, if I were to die right now in some sort of fiery explosion due to the carelessness of a friend, well, that would just be okay. Wow, it feels like something just dropped into my lower intestine. Hey, smells like cherry. Or maybe grape. Blueberry? Here it is, the sunset! I always love to count it down. Five... You do the rest, buddy. I guess we started too early. Let's start again. Hey, Squidward, check this out! Squidward, we already played babble like an idiot. Well, since we finished everything on the list, I thought I'd make up a new one. I already filled up this book of ideas. We should be able to finish by January. You want me to explode? Um, okay, I'll try. Gary! You are gonna finish your dessert, and you are gonna like it! Now it's your turn! Oh, good one. Why would I do that? What pie? Pie...pie... Oh, you mean this pie! I was saving it in my pocket for us to share. Let's eat! Oops! Look, Mr. Krabs. I'm doing it, I'm doing it! Why, yes. Yes I am. The Krabby Patty formula is the sole property of the Krusty Krab and is only to be discussed in part or in whole with its creator, Mr. Krabs. Duplication of this formula is punishable by law. Restrictions apply, results may vary. SpongeBob. Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, as long as these pants are square, and this sponge is Bob, I will not let you down! Code twelve, code twelve! Your disguises can't fool me this time, Plankton! Sorry, Mr. Krabs, I was just trying to protect the secret formula. No free napkins? Only discuss the formula with Mr. Krabs. Hi, Mr. Krabs. No sign of Plankton, yet. Gosh, Mr. Krabs. You don't look so good. Ooh, you're so cold. I got it, I got it.I got it, I got it Hey, Mr. Krabs, what happened to your metal pants? You gave him the day off. Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs, sir! Hey, Mr. Krabs, just taking out that garbage. Whoa-ho, Mr. Krabs. I didn't know you had heat vision. But I thought you wanted to ask me a question. I don't know, Mr. Krabs... I don't know. Mr. Krabs... Wha... Scrub-a-dub-dub, I love to rub. Hey, Mr. Krabs, just doing a little scrubbin'. I can see that, Mr. Krabs. Isn't that a microphone? But, sir, we haven't done the secret handshake yet. We don't shake with our hands, remember? We stand on one foot. Balance a glass of chocolate milk on our heads and sing the Bikini Bottom National Anthem. Almost. Sorry, no can do, Mr. Krabs. It's your rule. Never speak the formula. You told me to keep it in...this bottle.  Quiet! Until I know who the real Mr. Krabs is, nobody moves, nobody gets hurt. I'll do the talking around here. I think I'll just ask you two a couple of questions. Questions only the real Mr. Krabs could answer. First question: What time does the Krusty Krab open? Right. That's one strike, Mr. Fake. Nuh-uh-uh! I'm running this quiz show, I'll ask the questions. If there's gonna be any 'buts,' they're gonna be from me. Okay, question number two: How much does a Krabby Patty cost? On Wednesday... Right again! You're starting to look pretty phony right about now. I'd be nervous if I were you. Now only the really real Mr. Krabs could answer this — If we're discussing the secret formula on the third Wednesday in January and it's not raining outside after we've gargled with vanilla pudding, what do we do? So long, Imitation Krabs! Buh-bye! I knew it was you all along, Mr. Krabs, here you go. Oop! Don't forget your lucky penny. This must be your lucky day. If that was Plankton... Uh-oh! Mr. Krabs! Gee, Mr. Krabs. I'm sorry. I thought you were a phony. Really? Gee, Patrick, I didn't know you spoke bird. This whole sack? Uh sorry, I don't speak Italian. What's that lump in its belly? Wait! You forgot about this pet! Look at him Patrick, isn't he great? Hey, little fella. Aw look, isn't he just precious? Let's take him out to play. 998, 999, 1, 000. Ready or not, here I come! I know, Patrick, days like today only come once, maybe twice in a lifetime. Savor every moment. And it's all thanks to Wormy. I made this for Wormy. Our new best friend. Until tomorrow, new best friend. Don't be sad, little buddy. We'll be back first thing in the morning for frolic and fun. Aw, don't be sad, Patrick. It's only until tomorrow. Here I come, Wormy! He's gotta be in here. I think something bad happened to Wormy. I don't know, Patrick. But whatever it is...it must've eaten Wormy! Quick, Patrick! We've gotta make a run for the door! No! Patrick, he's blocking our only exit! Let's not panic. We just have to stick together. Remember, it's two against one. Right, Patrick? Patrick? He's eaten Patrick! Patrick, you're alive! Patrick, we can't leave this horrible monster in Sandy's house. It might eat Sandy's other pets! No, it might eat Sandy! We've gotta get it out of here! It's working. He's gonna answer it. You look pretty appetizing, Patrick. Now, just stay here and wait for the monster. I'll go get the net. Hold on, Patrick! I'm coming, Patrick! No, Mr. Monster, please don't eat me! No, no, no! Spare me, I don't taste good, no! Please! Wait a second. Yeah! We did it, Patrick! Sandy's gonna be so proud of us. We got that horrible monster out of her house and best of all her pets are safe. 'Cause that horrible creature is now......heading straight for the Krusty Krab! It's going in the front! Let's use the secret entrance. Hit the deck, Mr. Krabs! We're in serious danger. There's a-a-a...a monster out there. Oh no, Mr. Krabs. It doesn't want to eat Krabby Patties. It wants to eat YOU! Why? Why? He was so young. A living nightmare! We tried to warn them. I can't watch. Squidward? It ate them! And there it goes! First Wormy, then Squidward, Mr. Krabs! That flying monster has eaten three friends too many. We must inform the citizens! Evil has surfaced. The faith of Bikini Bottom is in our hands, Patrick. Now let's roll. Okay, Patrick, this is a very delicate situation. It must be treated with great care and sensitivity. Run, everybody, run! Monster! We did it, Patrick! We saved the city! Just think what might of happened if we didn't tell everyone about the monster. Sandy caught the monster! Ah! Mr. Krabs, a customer! Here you go, sir. I have an idea! Mr. Krabs, I have an idea! Mr. Krabs, I have an idea! Mr. Krabs, I have an idea! Mr. Krabs, I have an idea! OK. Prepare yourself, Mr. Krabs. Don't bother sitting down, Mr. Krabs, because you'll just stand up when you see this! Ta-da! Mr. Krabs, it's not tainted meat. It's painted meat Pretty Patties! Available in 6 designer colors. No. Stop it I know this is a good idea. I'll show you! I'll... I'll... I'll open my own restaurant! You'll see! Hey, Patrick, are you angry, too? What's the matter? I have a good idea, and no one else thinks so. I'm gonna open up a restaurant and sell Pretty Patties! Are you ready for the big rush, Patrick? Pretty soon those hungry customers will be lining up, because we are open. I'm ready! I'm ready. I'm ready... Patrick, how long have we been standing here? What if Mr. Krabs was right? Maybe my idea is dumb. I'm scared. Did you find anything? Yes, sir! We sell Pretty Patties! Mr. Krabs was right! What am I going to do with all these? Uhhh... I don't know. At first we didn't know what to do with all the money. We tried burying it... ...shredding it... ...and burning it. But in the end, we decided just to give it all away. Who's #46,853? Here you are, sir. Stay pretty. All right. Mr. Krabs is that you? Isn't this great, Mr. Krabs? The Pretty Patties are a big hit. No, sir, I haven't. Sometimes I really miss the old days back at the Krusty Krab. Yeah. Yeah! But do you know what I miss the most, Mr. Krabs? That tiny squeaking sound you get when you rub two pickles together. You know what I mean, Mr. Krabs? Oh, I can't leave, Mr. Krabs. What about the stand? You will? What did you say, Mr. Krabs? Thank you. What should I do now, Mr. Krabs? I can't feel my legs, Mr. Krabs. Dreams do come true. There it is! Grandma's house! What wonders await me today? Fresh-baked cookies? Story time? A sweater with love in every stitch? Aw, what am I waiting for? Grandma, Grandma, Grandma! Hi, Grandma! Grandma, you make the best cookies in the deep blue sea. Oh yeah... Grandma's cookies... Me, me, me! Tell me another story about when I was a baby. Three o'clock? I'm gonna be late for work! Thanks, Grandma! I sure did. Bye, Grandma, thanks for the ride. Thank you, Squidward. Isn't this great? Everybody's in a good mood today. Did I do something funny? My forehead is funny? No, you're wrong! There's nothing wrong with getting kisses from your grandma. Really? You do, Squidward? Stop it...! I have been publicly humiliated for the last time! Me, too. Thanks, Patrick. You're right, Patrick. Yeah! Oh, but I'm not sure I know how. Tax exemption. I'm a grownup. A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. Patrick, we didn't say that. All we need now is the icing on the maturity cake. I've been growing these babies for years. Sorry, grandmother, but the kissing has to stop. He is right, Grandmother. Kisses are for babies, which I am no longer. I have grown up. It is nature's way. I am? I mean, of course I am. I am glad you see it my way, grandmother. Sorry, grandmother, we adults don't partake in the consumption of sweets, right, Pat... ...rick? So much for no more baby stuff. Hey, that's my cookie-eating hat! I mean it was when I was a baby. Grandmother, I need to have a mature conversation with Mr. Patrick. Patrick! What are you doing?! Cookies?! Warm milk?! A bib?! Is that a kissy mark on your forehead?! We are supposed to be adults! Poor Patrick. I almost feel sorry for you. Trapped in the awkward phase of diaper days... never to know the rich rewards of being a grownup. Well, yeah, there's, eh... well, let's see, we... We went over the jazz... It appears to be my lunch hour. Grownups have to eat to. I guess this will have to do. Oh yeah, uh... great. Nutritious. Storytime? Oh, uh... great. Yeah. Fascinating. No pictures, just the way I like it. Huh? No... Don't I get a present, Grandma? Uh, I don't need to leave yet. I can be late for work. Alright, I guess I'll be going. I've, uh, got a lot of adult-type business to take care of, so, uh, I'll see yah later. Yep, that is it. Here I go. Out into the cold, grown-up world alone without a sweater. I don't know when I'll be back. So, uh... that's it. Soo long... I don't wanna grow up! I want cookies! and "milkie"! I want a sweater with love in the stitches! I wanna wear "diadies"! I wanna ride in my wagon! I wanna cuddle-wuddle with Mister Stuffykins! I wanna rocky-rock on my seahorsey! And I want kissy-kissy on my boo-boo! I don't? Thanks, Grandma. Uh, Grandma, could you not mention this to the guys down at the Krusty Krab? Patrick, look. I got my... I'm sorry, Patrick. It's just for a second I thought... Patrick, you made my house sparkling clean. We haven't improved Squidward's day yet. Let's do his house! My turn. We're playing with our new reef blowers! But it's fun! Let's do your house, Patrick. Squidward, you're steaming! You're like a steamed vegetable, only smarter. No problem, Squidward! We're on your side! Any second now… Here it is, Patrick. Now we've just got to convince Squidward to come back home. You got our apology cake? We're ready! But you just ate three orders of fried oyster skins! Hey! That looked like Squidward! That looked like Squidward also, in angry mob form! Patrick, look! It's Squidward! Squidward! We finally found you! Are you Squidward? Are you Squidward? Any one of these Squidward's can be the real Squidward, Patrick! Well, we know one thing: it sure isn't that guy! I am raking the leaves. Sandy, I can't rake any faster. These are big leaves. And they keep breaking into more leaves. What's the big rush anyway, Sandy? Hibernating? What's that? Can I do that? Sandy, you may not have noticed, but I is 100% ma-male. Why, Sandy? When does your... "carburation" begin? But Sandy, that only gives us 1, 2, 3... 168 more hours of playtime! Climb! Jump! Ride! Wait, Sandy! Sandy? Sandy, I'm willing to sacrifice any of my time that I haven't already sold to Mr. Krabs to you. Life's as extreme as you want to make it! Whoo! Yeah. Whew, what a workout. I'm going to be feeling this tomorrow. Ow. Well, I'd better get home before Gary chews up the sofa again. Good night, Gary. W-what h-happened to s-sleeping? Yeah! I've never played extreme jacks before! Sandy, are you sure we're supposed to be standing up here? Gee, that sounds safe! I mean, fun. Okay, I'm ready! I thought you said we were riding through the park, Sandy! This squirrel's trying to kill me! Any more of these stunts and I'll be reduced to a puddle! Wait a minute, I've got to talk my way out of this! Sandy, I think I need to tell you something. Well, it's just that I'm feeling sort of... I just feel like maybe I need to... Not yet. You do that. Gotta hide! Uh-G-Gotta hide! Home? No. Gary can't keep a secret. Under a rock? It's so original! You said it! Sandy'll never find us! Hey, wait, you don't understand! C'mon, let me back in! You don't understand! Sandy, wait! Sandy, you've got to make time! This is important! I...am a man! Okay, Sandy, I...I...I...I...I can't play with you anymore! I just can't take the games! They're tearing me apart! There, I said it! Now just promise we can still be friends. Please, Sandy? This isn't easy, I... Sandy? I never thought I'd say it, but thank Neptune for hibernation! But, Mr. Krabs, what about all the stuff you stole? Like that barrel. It says, "Property of Salty Sea Farms". Are you renting the barrel, too? Then you bought it? Then, isn't that stealing? And this Bikini Bell phone? ...And Plankton's lawn mower? Even Mrs. Puff's hair curlers? Borrowed? Well, that's a relief. I thought you took it without permission. What do you want to do today? I don't know. What do you want to do today? I don't know. What do you want to do today? It's okay, Patrick. There's lots of money in the First National Bank of SpongeBob. Follow me! Uh-oh. I'm broke, too. Maybe we could borrow money from Squidward? Yeah, like Mr. Krabs! Yeah, and borrowing is okay as long as we bring it back, right? We're going to have so much fun! First we can run with the balloon! Yeah! then we can take a bike ride with the balloon. Then we can go to the movies and the arcade and the ice rink and the pizza shop! And the candy shop! And in a plane! And under a hill! It popped. I got the pieces! Hurry, put the pieces on! We popped the balloon! We can't return it! We're thieves! We have to confess. You're right, we've just got to keep our heads. Act normal. It's not safe for Bikini Bottom anymore. We've got to move fast and cover our tracks. Take a last look Patrick. We can never go back. We've only got ourselves and what we can carry on our backs. We're going to have to travel lighter. We can never go home, Pat. We're wanted men. We'll spend the rest of our lives running...running, but at least it's warmer on the fire. No more nice, warm beds. No more Krabby Patties. No more getting mail! (Originally "No more getting nailed! Followed by Patrick nailing himself) No more Gary! No more movies! No more Squidward! No more Sandy or Pearl or Mr. Krabs! No more anything! But it doesn't have to be all bad, right? I mean, at least we have each other. And all that running is good for your buns and thighs, right? Yeah! Maybe being a felon could be... ...fun! We can loosen our ties. Yeah! Okay... we still can't do that! But at least we don't have to shave. And you get to talk tough! This town ain't big enough for the two of us. And the best part is: now that we're felons, we don't have to return anything we borrowed! What are you talking about? Taking the balloon was your evil plan. Aw, Patrick... you're the best bad influence ever! Look what I've got! Not just any rectangles...Candy bars! All we have to do is make them last for the rest of our lives! You just ate it, Pat. It's all over your face. What? No, I didn't. You ate yours, this is mine. Here Patrick, just take half of mine. Do you want it or what? This is my candy bar! It's "pants on fire", Patrick. Well, if you're going to be that way... I'll eat it myself. Did I, Patrick, did I? Or did your criminal mind hypnotize me to steal it?! Not if I tell on you first! You're going to get in trouble. We stole a balloon. What are you going to do to us? But...But...we stole a balloon. Let's vow never to borrow anything without permission again. I sure am! I'm ready! Today, I'm gonna sneak up and get that Sandy with a super sneaky karate move. What diabolical act is she committing now? Fire! Don't worry, Sandy, I'm coming! Stand back, Sandy, fire! Huh? So I guess there's no fire? Christmas who? Is she a friend from Texas? Tell me more about this... ..."Christmas." And everyone pretends to like the fruitcake. But the best part is you can write a letter to this guy, Santa Claus, and tell him what you want, and when he comes he brings it to you. That's the spirit, Mr. Krabs. Here you go! You can get started on your letter. Okay, who's next? Here you go, Patrick. Not yet. C'mon, Squidward. Write a letter. Sure, buddy. Here you go. Okie dokie, Squid... ...ward. Here, Patrick, watch me. Dear Santa, what do I want for Christmas, you may ask? All I want is for you to visit gentle folk here in Bikini Bottom. That is my wish. Patrick, I designed this mechanism specifically to shoot bottles to the surface. The hopes of everyone rests on the success of its maiden voyage. Fire in the hole! Santa doesn't come till Christmas Eve. Great, Mr. Krabs. What did you wish for? Really? What did you wish for, Patrick? And what did you wish for, little girl? Great, Squidward, you finished. What's your wish? Gee, Squidward, maybe Santa will bring me a dictionary so I can understand what you just said. Okay, everybody, we've got a lot to do now that we've summoned Santa Claus. We must ready ourselves for his arrival. ♪La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!♪ Ahh, that's the last letter. Huh? Wait! Squidward hasn't written his letter yet! Squidward! Hurry! Squidward, Squidward! Hurry! Don't worry, Squidward. I'll help you get started. Dear Santa Claus... Right, too formal. Hi Santa... Howdy, Claus? But, Squidward, when Santa comes, you'll be the only one without a gift. C’mon, Squid, all you have to do is write a letter. What have you got to lose? Squidward, c'mon. C'mon, Squidward. C'mon! C’mon everybody! Let's sing till Santa gets here. Uh, he should be here any minute. ♪Santa's coming tonight, tonight. Santa's coming tonight.♪ Hey, guys, where's your Christmas Spirit? He's just running late. Yeah! Santa Claus. You were right, Squidward. This is a stupid holiday. I still want you to have this. A present. I made it for you so you wouldn't be left out when... Santa came! "" You're welcome. I guess I won't be needing this. That's better. I'd better get this stuff off of Squid's place. Huh? Hello? Who's there? Huh? Hello? Hello? Yes. Who's there? Huh? Hello? Show yourself. Yoo-hoo. Hello? Who is it? Huh? C-c-could it be? Hey, you're S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San... S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San... S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San... S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San... ta... S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San... I knew you'd make it, Santa. Hey, Santa, where's your big, round belly? Where's your reindeer? And your flying machine? And what about that nose? I knew you were suppose to have a big one but, that thing's gigantic. Santa! This is the greatest you could've given me. Thank you for bringing Christmas to Bikini Bottom. I did? Go ahead, Santa Claus. See, he is real. He made my Christmas wish come true, he won't let you down. Squidward! You missed him! He was here just like I said! He gave us all presents. He was jolly and he had a beard. His nose was big and he had rosy cheeks. He was friendly and kind. And Santa is... oh, his belly was small but his nose was huge with Christmas joy. He was so nice Squidward... Ahoy, Patrick! It's Christmas Island! Hooray! Oh, a storm! Alright, we're gonna go to Sandy's house! Yeah! Ha-ha! Keep the tree warm, Sandy, we're on our way to your house! Ha-ha-ha... Sandy? Hey, Sandy, what's with the sign? Never mind, Pat. Sandy said not to come in. Let's am-scray. Patrick, listen, how many times do we have to-? What is this stuff? Wow, Patrick, that was beautiful. Patrick! Put your helmet back on! You know there's no water in Sandy's house! I guess you're right. It's okay here! I think it came from Sandy's tree. Let's check it out. Look what's in Sandy's bed! I think this thing is Sandy. She must be dreaming about Texas outlaws. Look out, Sandy, I'm Dirty Dan. Oh, you better run faster, Sandy. Hurry, we're getting in a taxi! Come on, Patrick. We shouldn't disturb her anymore. Ha! That is really disturbing! Huh? Sandy! No! Stop! Sandy, it's us, your friends! SpongeBob and Patrick! Whew, we sure don't want to wake her up again. Too bad we don't have any earplugs to put on her. All right, Pat! Well, that oughta work. Hey, Sandy, if you can't hear us, don't say anything! See ya later, Sheriff Sandy! You're under arrest! They couldn't afford station wagons either! All right, Pinhead. Your time is up! What makes you think you can be Dirty Dan? I say I'm Dirty Dan. I say I'm Dirty Dan! I'm Dirty Dan! I'm Dirty Dan! I'm Dirty Dan! I'm Dirty Dan! I'm Dirty Dan! Patrick! Sandy, stand back. I'm warning ya! Okay, I warned ya! Let's get out of here before Sandy wakes up again! Sorry, Patrick, but the door is slippery! It's frozen shut! Then we're stuck in here...until the door thaws...in spring. N-n-n-no. I'm so cold... that I can use my nose drippings as a pair of chopsticks! Maybe we should build a fire. I got it! We'll burn the bark from Sandy's tree! The fire's not gonna happen, Patrick. I don't get it! How does Sandy survive these intense conditions every year? Maybe... Maybe it's her fur! Look at all that warm, toasty fur. Carefully...carefully? All right, all right, hang on a second! That should be enough, right? Well, I guess I've lived a full life! Pat, no! Pat, are you crazy?! Let me see that roll of tape. And this eyebrow/goatee combo works like a charm. This is the best idea we've ever had. I'm ready for the longest, coldest winter ever! Spring? Tartar sauce! The lock is still frozen! It's okay, Sandy. Squirrel pattern baldness is quite common in small mammals! Don't worry, Sandy, we've got you covered. Oh, I've got ya now, Gary. Tag, you're it! Gary will never find me here! Uh-oh. Tag! Now I'm it! Gary and I are playing tag, you wanna join us? Okay, Tag, you're it! That's just a snail's way of saying he likes you! Well, I guess it's time for me and the Gare-Bear to get going. Come on, Gary. Boy, I can't wait to hit the hay. What about you, Gary? Gary? Gary? Hey Patrick, have you seen Gary? Come on Gary, we gotta let Patrick go to sleep. Hey, that's a great idea! Gee, this is great. My two best friends in the whole sea having a sleepover. OK, you two have a good time. I'll see you tomorrow. I'm awake! Hey, guys, how was the sleepover? Come on, Gary! Try and catch meeee! Isn't this great, Gary? Me running around and you chasing me? You're not chasing me… Who-ho-ho-ho! Look out! I'm right in front of… …you… What's wrong with me? Do I offend? Hey, Gary! Gary, look! It's your favorite ball! Hey, Gary, look! Snail-nip! Huh? Huh-huh? Help, Gary, help! Help me! Oh, merciful Neptune! I closed the window on my head! All right, that's it! Gary, you stop this foolishness, right now. Gary the Snail, answer me when I'm talking to you! Okay, that's it, mister! You are coming home with me this instant! Say goodbye to Patrick, Gary. What's that supposed to mean? Fine, but I would like to remind him who it was who fed him and housed him and sat on his bedside when he was sick and massaged his eyestalks when his eyes were sore! Okay, Gary, go ahead, show him. Okay, Gary, come to me! Come on, come on, Gary! Come on, come here, Gary! Uh, wrong way, Gary. G-Gary, turn around! Gary, no, Gary, no, no, no! Don't do it, Gary! Okay, fine, if that's how you want to thank me… ...for all that I've done?! I guess you're not coming back, Gary. I don't need Gary! I'll just find another pet! Yeah, it'll be better than Gary! I'm going to get a pet that won't go off with my best friend! Hi, guys! Say hello to my new pal Rex! Not only is he loyal, but he knows tricks, too! Watch and learn. Sit, Rex, sit! Roll over, Rex, roll over! Now stay, Rex, stay! Good boy, Rex! Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? I'm sure glad we went our separate ways, Gary. A worm really is the pet for me. So loyal, so trusting, always by my side! Who needs worms anyway? Welcome home, newest bestest friend. Come on out, don't be shy. You remind me of someone I once knew. A certain someone whose name will not be spoken in this household. Come on, let me show you around, Lary. And now, Lary, I present to you… dinner time! Ta-da. Bon appetite, Lary. Okay, maybe later. This is where you sleep, Lary. Uh, that's where I… I guess you can sleep there… I'll just sleep down here. Well, good night, Lary. Hey, Lary, want to hear a joke? Aw, Gary used to love this one! What do you call a snail on a ship? A snailor! Don't you get it, Lary? A snailor. Gosh, Lary is sure different than Gary. And Gary and Lary are real different than Jerry. Oh, Gary, why did you have to go?! Why, Gary?! Why…?! Why, why, why, why, why?! Gary? Oh, hello, Patrick. Hello, Gary. Laundry? But… we used to do laundry… Soap? But… we used to use soap. Do you want 'Fresh Scent' or 'Heavy Du'… Du… du… duuuuu… ttyyyyy! Gary! Please come back, Gary! Please come home! I'm a wreck without you! I know. If you come back, there'll be a new no-rules rule. You can do whatever you want, when you want. If you feel like rippin' the sofa, then you rip it up! And the litter box? Forget about it! The world is your litter box! And you don't even have to wait around for me to feed you anymore! 24-hour fridge access! And you don't even have to use a bowl! And I know how much you like my prized drift wood carving of Squidward. Well, think of it as your own personal scratching post! What do you think, Gary? Won't it be fun, Gary? Gary…? No, Patrick. He wanted the cookie in your pocket! G-G-Gary? Whee! Oh, Gary, I knew you'd never leave me! Aww… Let's go for a walk, pal! What happened? How many does that leave me with? How many more minutes left in the test? That's enough time, I can make up those points! Okay, Mrs. Puff, what's my final score? Whoo! And how many do I need to pass? Whoo. What? Don't worry. I'll be all right, Mrs. Puff. Besides, this means that I get to be in your class for a whole 'nother year! Well, see you next Tuesday! Yeah! I'm gonna get my driver's license and it's only gonna take one more year, one more year, one more superduper year. One more super-spectacular, extra-magical, extra-fantastical year! What was that, Mrs. Puff? What's extra credit? Oh….. Extra credit! But I've learned so many things. L… e… a… r… Oh, barnacles. Got to sharpen my pencil. N… e… A pen! One of the most permanent of all writing utensils. Gonna write an essay, that's what I say. There. No, wait! I changed my mind! Don't look! It's not ready. I can do this! I can do this! I can do this! I can do this! Is it hot in here, Mrs. Puff? Why is it so hot in here? My hand is cramping, Mrs. Puff! Make it stop! It's not ready yet. No! No! Mrs. Puff, I don't feel like I really did anything. Really? My license! It tastes just like I dreamt it would. Mrs. Puff, I- Look out, Bikini Bottom! There's a new driver on the road and his name is...SpongeBob SquarePants! SpongeBob SquarePants! SpongeBob SquarePants! La La La La! La La La La! La la la la! To the greatest teacher ever! For me...? What I learned in Boating School today is! Hi, Boaty. Boaty, you're cold! Take my socks. Oh, Boaty, I'm always going to take care of you. You're the best boat in the deep blue sea! Hey, I'm driving! Who are you and what are you doing with my boat? And why are you wearing that ski mask?! Because you're not skiing! Oh my gosh, I know who you are! Yes, I do! I know that you're... a boat-jacker! I never thought I'd have to use this pepper spray! Somebody help me! Somebody help me! Give me back my boat! You'd better stop this boat! I'm… not… letting… go! Nothing will stop me! Not even… Giant clams?! I'm… not… letting… go… not even for… Cheese graters?! If you think I'll let go just for a little… educational television?! Oh, no! I'd never let you have this boat! Not even if you were… … Mrs. Puff? So, how's it going, Mrs. Puff? So, I guess I got to give my license back, huh? You kidding? You're the only teacher for this student . And besides, the warden said she'll let you go early, if you do her a favor? Free driving lessons! Wow! I can't believe it! We're actually here at the biannual Jellyfish Convention! Cool! State-of-the-art jellyfish nets! Wow! The harpoon from "Jellyfish: The Movie!" Look! Dr. Manowar! The guy who got stung by Big Lenny and lived! Oh! Patrick, look! Can it be? No, it's the Jellyspotters! Bikini Bottom's premier jellyfish enthusiast club! Ah! And their leader! The coolest jellyfish enthusiast ever! Kevin the Sea Cucumber! If I could just touch the hem of his pocket protector, then maybe some of his greatness would rub off on me. Hi, Kevin. Hi, Kevin. Hi, Kevin. Hi, Kevin. Hi, Kevin. I'm your biggest fan. No, wait! I would do anything for you! Anything! Do you want it to hurt me, Kevin? I'd love it! Uh... here we are, Jellyfish Fields. Ohh... I didn't forget them, Kevin. They're in the trunk. I can't believe I'm actually out here with the Jellyspotters! I mean all my life I wanted to be a Jellyspotter... ...and now I'm out here with you guys with the nets and the jars and the jellyfish and I'm with Kevin and Kevin's with me and we're all with each other and we're all jellyfishing and it's fun and- Hey, I caught one! Am I a Jellyspotter now? Oh, Uh, let's see, one, two, three? Who wants to lick my cheeks? I see I have some takers! It tickles my nose! Am I in the Jellyspotters now? Am I in the Jellyspotters now? Am I in the Jellyspotters now? Now? Now? Now? Now? Now? Now? I'm ready! A queen? Can I help? This is fantastic! I've never been bait before! I don't think I've ever seen a queen jellyfish either. Hey, I've heard this call before. Hey, where are you going? This is great! When I pass this test, I'll be an official jellyfish spotter! Hey, Kevin. I don't think it's working. Nothing. Hey, hey, Kevin! She's here! Look, she's here! She's here, Kevin! She... Please don't be angry, your highness! I would have let you go! Kevin! But... What about my final test? But, Kevin, I was your biggest fan! I am not a loser! King Jellyfish! Now what do we do? Everybody loves pie! Wow, I didn't know this was a hat! Hi, Patrick! Yeah, but I turned them down. It's not about Kevin, it's about jellyfish! ManSponge... Oh my gosh, Patrick. This is the greatest wall of superhero super gadgetry ever! I'm going to play with the Cosmic-Ray! What about the Orb of Confusion? Come Boy Patrick. While our heroes are away, we will keep evil at bay. What is it, trusted sidekick? Looks like he's frozen or something. It appears to be some sort of prison chamber... ...made out of frozen tartar sauce. This is incredible. Next to the Dirty Bubble, the evil Man Ray is the all-time greatest arch nemesis of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. I have so many questions to ask him. Pat, what are you doing? We're not supposed to touch anything! We could get in trouble. He said not to touch anything and that includes unfreezing a super-villain! Uh, actually, Mr. uh... Man Ray, sir, only your head is free. Well, uhh, Mr. Evil Man Ray, sir, we can't do that. Because you're evil! Yeah, sure, why not? Really? Really, really? Really, really, really? Well, that's good enough for me. Don't play dumb, Man Ray! You know that's the tickle belt Mermaid Man used on you in episode #17. Oh, me too, me too. Remember that part Mermaid Man and Barnacle... We could teach you how to be good and then we'll let you go. Okay, Man Ray. Are you ready first day at goodness school? Pat, get your wallet out. Okay, goodness lesson number one. You see someone drop their wallet. Patrick, drop the wallet. Now, what do you do? No. Wrong. Good people don't rip other people's arms off Okay, goodness lesson number two. You see someone struggling with a heavy package. What do you do? Alright, goodness lesson number three. Uhh, let's see. Hey, Patrick, that's got nothing to do with being good. Pat, we've got to use it only when he's bad. No, you let go! Did you hear that, Patrick? He said the P word. No. Please. Rehabilitated. It's graduation day, Man Ray. This is the key to your future. Just look at him, Patrick. The picture of goodness. Umm, we're not supposed to touch that stuff. We're not supposed to touch that, either. We are really not suppose to touch those, sir. Good people have no use for weapons such as... thoooose! That, Patrick, is the smell of defeat. Forget about your skin, Patrick. Man Ray is still bad and someone has to stop him. This is a job for Mermaid Man... To the Invisible Boatmobile! Wait! I don't have a license. You're the best sidekick ever, Barnacle Boy. Not so fast, arch-villain. We still have the Orb of Confusion. Take this! Doy. Duh. Doy. Man Ray! Bye, Man Ray! Wow. We did it! Just like the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. We saved the day. Isn't it incredible, Patrick? Patrick? Patrick, you know that thing's turned off, right? Patrick? Yoo-hoo? Patrick? I hope I do as good as that guy. Hey, hey, hey ladies and jellyfish, have you ever noticed salt shakers? I mean, you fill them up every night at closing, and I mean, where does it all go? Huh? You know what I mean? And tomatoes -- what's the deal on those things? I mean, you chop them up into slices, but... What are they, vegetables or... fruit? And what does that make? Ketchup? Umm, noxious gas? Did you ever notice how, uhh... ...forks, uhh... Quick, SpongeBob, make a witty observation! Did you ever notice how big squirrels' teeth are? I mean, hey, you could land a plane on those things. And what's up with all that squirrel fur? I guess fleas need a home, too. And they smell! But hey, you'd stink too if you spent three months buried in dirt. Hey, why does it take more than one squirrel to change a light bulb? Because, they're so darn stupid! I never thought I could be a head-liner! Whatever that is. At least I don't have to clean up my act! Mops, mops, mops, what's up with those things? I mean, really. Oh, hey, Sandy! Did you enjoy the show? Come on, Sandy, I was just joking. I mean, everybody knows that you're the smartest one in Bikini Bottom. We all gotta laugh at ourselves once in a while. I do it all the time! La-la-la-la-la-la. Squirrely, squirrely, squirrely, squirrel. Because they're stupid. Because they're stupid. Oh, hi, Sandy. We already talked about that, remember? Ah, that's just Patrick. He's just fooling around. Other jokes? Bah! I got a million of them. Uhh, hi. Uhh, did you hear about the goldfish who went bankrupt? Now he's a bronze fish. I guess you heard that one. Thank you, you're too kind. Hey, what about this water! I mean, the stuff's everywhere. Uhh... Hey, what about this thing! Huh? Huh? What do I do? Who do I do? SpongeBob, you've got a choice to make: your friends or your career. Howdy, y'all! How come it takes more than one squirrel to screw in a light bulb? My people! But seriously folks, I want to give a special thanks to my friend, Sandy. Sandy, don't you see? The crowd loves these jokes. Am I right? Don't you see, Sandy? We're laughing with you, not at you! Do you understand now, Sandy? Huh, do you? Great. I knew sooner or later you'd get it. What a great sport. Let's give a big hand for Sandy! But clap slow, because remember... She's a squirrel! Thank you! You've been a wonderful audience, and uhh, good night! Ah... another spectacular performance, SpongeBob. Oh, what's this, a fan letter? You did it, SpongeBob. You get to keep your career and your friends. I'm glad that Sandy can finally see the genius of my comedy. Good morning, Sandy. Sandy, are you feeling alright? Uhh, Sandy, I think something's wrong with this seat. But, Sandy, that, that's not a... Sandy, I need wa... Wa... Wa... Sandy! Water! Sandy! Sandy! Okay, Sandy, I get it! Okay, Sandy, okay! I get it! No more squirrel jokes. Thank you, thank you very much. Well, on my way over here, I ran into a squirrel. And I said, 'Hey, why don't you go get a couple of squirrel friends and we'll go change a light bulb.' But seriously folks, the only thing dumber than a squirrel is a sponge! I mean, we're so dumb, we don't even have a vertebrae! Look at me! I got no bones! Crabs? Oh, brother. They're so cheap, they can't even pay attention! Now, let me tell you about those fish? Boy, are they smelly. Whoo-hoo! I mean how can a creature that spends so much time in the water smell so bad? I mean, really! Soap... soap... what is... soap? And don't even get me started on starfish! Yup, and just relax. Oooh! Oooh! Do you know what that cloud looks like? A flower. They sure do. Me either. Who wants to get all dirty anyway? Yeah. That's funny, Sandy. That sounded like you said you could beat me at a climbing contest. I thought that meant you were nuts. Land-shmand, it's all about finger strength, baby, and if there's anything we've got plenty of down here, it's finger strength! What do you think about that, "Miss Mittens"? Ahh! Hey, no fair, Sandy! You got a head start! Hey! You did that on purpose! Aaaaah! I didn't! I want a rematch! First one to the Krusty Krab is the winner! I can underwater! I'm... Hydrodynamically designed! Think you can win a fair race in that clunky tin tube? I'd say I'm already halfway there!-halfway there! -halfway there!-halfway there!  There you are! Ain't that just like a land creature to keep a sea creature waiting! I did! And I took a head start like you did! I guess I don't, air breather! Tree climber! Kite flier! Take that back! You- not wet person! Proves what? Good one, Squidward! Woo! I'll admit, you've got some pretty good moves. For a squirrel. But you're still just a land creature. Can you reproduce by budding. Can ya? Can ya? Can ya? Can ya? Most importantly...can you do this? Admit it, Sandy, you can't do anything us sea creatures can do. In fact, if wasn't for that suit, you couldn't live down here! I don't know! Wow, Sandy. You sure proved us wrong. I guess land creatures are better. At least until they need to breathe... Yep, won't be long now. Feelin' light-headed yet? Remember this? One minute? No problem, Landy! Actually, you know, but... Yeah, we're not chicken, we'll do it. There. Mission accomplished. No, way, San-day. We can take on your challenge! Where not afraid of your dumb old land! We're sea creatures! Okay... Well, this is it. Thanks, Mr. Krabs. Okay! Here I go! Hey, this isn't so bad. We can do this! Hey, Patrick, come on up! The air is fine! All right, Pat, you made it! Come on, Mr. Krabs! Up here! Looking good, Mr. Krabs! Come on, Squidward, you're missing all the dry. Come on, Squidward! Well, here we are. We're the masters of land and sea! Hey, it’s a local. Hi, we're from underwater. Do you know Sandy Cheeks? Uh, thanks for saving us, Sandy. But no one's best at everything. Sorry I made you take off your helmet, Sandy. There it is... Oyster Stadium. Not only do they have the largest oyster held in captivity, it also does tricks! He spits a giant pearl 100 feet in the air, like a cannonball! You're right, Patrick. We came to see pearls 100 feet in the air! Right? I'll try my oyster call. Come on, come on, wake up already! I think it's working! Hey, Patrick, it's waking up! No, the show's about to begin! Uh... Right. I already said I didn't, Patrick, sheesh! Give it a rest, Patrick! There's no crime to investigate! Now go home! Stupid Patrick... I didn't do anything wrong! Aw, what am I getting so worked up about? I'm sure that by tomorrow, this whole ugly mess will be a funny memory. No, Gary! How would I know anything about the oyster? Defensive? I'm not being defensive! Barnacles! What is this, 20 Questions or something? This is getting a little out of hand. All I did was throw a peanut. I didn't mean to make the oyster cry! I just wanted to see it perform spectacular stunts! Aw, everyone's gonna hate me! I-I need some advice! Now, let's see now. Who could never hate me no matter what I do? Squidward! Squidward! Oh, Squidward! Sorry, neighbor. Funny thing you should mention that old oyster, because I... uh... was kind of wondering, um... Let's say I know this guy who may have something to do with the oyster.  Um, actually, I-I'm just talking hypothetically. Well, um... I... uh... no. Squidward? Hey, Patrick, what are you doing? Um... have you found out anything? I better go see Sandy, she'll know what to do! Uh, that's kind of what I wanted to talk about, Sandy. Twitchy? Twitchy? Who's twitchy? I'm not twitchy! Sorry, Sandy, I have to, um... um... go get my hair cut. Okay, uh, good luck with all that, Patrick, and, uh, I guess I'll see you later! Uh, uh, just a second! Y-y-yes? Y-yes! Yes... Yes! Yes! Yes! It's true! It's true! It's all true! The merriment, the peanut, the Patrick! Oh, no! Patrick's too sensitive for the big house! Wait! Stop! I'm the one you want! I am the criminal! Wait! Hold your peanuts! Patrick Star is innocent! I have come here to reveal the truth! They say that truth and honesty will be rewarded with trust and forgiveness! I'm here to lay my cards on the table, to trim the branches of deception from the tree of life, to shave away the unkempt sideburns from the face of truth! I... I am the one who threw the peanut! I know now that what I have done is wrong. And so I say, I am sorry, giant performing oyster. I am sorry, Patrick. I am sorry, citizens of Bikini Bottom. Mr. Krabs! Mother of pearl! The oyster's a mother! And that pearl's no pearl, it's an egg! Mmm, Kelp-O! With one of eight essential prizes inside! Holy shrimp! Squidward! The sky had a baby from my cereal box! Squidward! Squidward! The sky had a baby! I know! What do you think we should name it? We didn't do it, Squidward. Our hands are clean! Wouldn't that be the top? Squid, wait! Wait! Ship! No, look, a giant ship! I don't know, Squidward. That ship has a spooky green glow around it. Squid, wait! Doesn't this place seem familiar? I don't know. Doesn't it just kind of ring a bell? I know who owns this boat but I just can't place the name. No, no, it's not "rawr!" That's it! Squidward, this ship belongs to the Red Baron! It's Squidward. He wants to complain to you. Well, what about all that stuff about him having a dirty ship and being lazy and all? No, no, wait, it was his mother you said was dirty, not his ship. That was a closer one! No! We know our place now, Mister Dutchman. Look, Patrick! A real, live, ghost mop! You mean you want it to look good...and scary. Well, I think we can probably... Or maybe that by looking so scary you forget that it doesn't look good! Look, it's easy, it simply means that... So, you don't want it to look good?  Let's see who we can find. Captain, there's a guy we can scare. Keep going. You're good. You're good. You're good...and...stop. Don't worry, Cap'n, we'll buff out those scratches. Was that the signal? Okay, sorry, sorry, just...just do it again. You're good. You're good. You're good. You're good. You're good. You're good. You're good.. You're good. You're good. Why do you think the Dutchman asked us to wait in our bunk room? Like movie passes? You're setting us free? Really?! What is it? But the door is locked and the only way out is through the...perfume department. I always hate going in there! Wait! Listen! Never! No! Wow! Three wishes, Pat. Isn't that great? Well, we still have two more. How exciting! I wish Squidward were here to see this! Guess what? The Dutchman gave us three wishes! Patrick used the first one, and I guess I... just used the second one. Well, that's not right because... That's you, Patrick. Make your wish. Patrick, you've got to think harder than you've ever thought before. That's not gonna do it! Think harder! Come on, mister, let us out! Don't be so mean! Don't be so fatty! Squidward, you get a wish! A great big wish! Hi there, I don't believe we've met. My name is SpongeBob, and this is my associate Patrick. And what did you say your name was? Oh, nice to meet you, Squid-ward. We'll have plenty of time to get to know each other, I guess. Don't worry, Squidward. I've got it all figured out. He won't be able to eat us because...I wish the Dutchman was a vegetarian! We're home! Gary! Looks like it's that time of week again: bath time. Come on, let's go get the water started. You're gonna have to get in that tub, Gary. Now, Gary, we can do this the hard way, or the easy way, or the medium way, or the semi-medium-easy-hard way, or the sorta hard with a touch of awkward-easy-difficulty-challenging way... So that's how you wanna play it, huh? Gary! Check out this new toy. Fetch! Huh? "New" Boomerang Pet Ball: Really Works! Hmmm. Gary! There's a bomb strapped to my chest! It's gonna explode in 3 seconds unless you take a bath!... ...Please... ... I am now going to assault your mind with subliminal messages. I'm sorry you had to see that. Hello, Fancy French Restaurant? I've got a naughty snail here who won't take a bath. What? Can you say that again? Slow down, it's like you're speaking some other language! Hey, Gare! How 'bout some leap frog? Weehee! Okay, your turn. Hey, Gare! How 'bout some leap frog? ... I've got a crisp dollar bill for the next fella to take a bath in this house! Ya-da-da-da... That didn't work either, huh? Gary! Gary! Look what I found! It's an old, pirate treasure map revealing a location of buried pirate treasure in this very house. Come on, boy, let's go get that treasure. Whoo! Okay, Gary, now 40 paces to the left. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... 24, 25, 26, twenty seveeen... 40. The treasure must be in here! Wow, Gary, look! A pirate treasure chest. Why, no, Gary, this isn't the bathtub. It's treasure. Look, doubloons. Don't drop 'em... Look at this brooch! I don't know what a snail would want with a brooch! Now why don't you just get into the tub?! Get in the tub! Get in the tub!! Get in the tub... In the tub. In the tub! Now, Gary, are you gonna get in this tub or am I gonna have to... Gary, could you... Gary, no! Gary! . Alright, Gary, you have duped, and/or, frustrated me for the last time. So, if I can't get you to come to the bath, I'll just have to bring the bath to you. . Psst, Gary. Bath delivery. . Come back, Gary. I have something to "chair" with you. "Dishes" more like it. "Water" you waiting for, Gary? Aww, stuck in a tree? It's time to clean up your act, Gary. . Oh, no! I bathed Gary too hard and removed his skin. Gary! Bring that ladder back this instant. I am really not amused, mister. You are going to take a bath, and you are going to get clean right now. I am so the boss of you! It may be a free country, but you live in my house under my rules. Don't use that tone of voice with me. You will do what I say when I say. What are you doing? I am talking to you, mister. Do not go near that mud puddle! Gary, the snail, do you hear me? I am giving you three seconds to get away from that mud puddle. One, two, two and a half... don't make me say three! Gary! Gary! Gary! Gary!! I'm a dirty boy. Yeah, yeah, Gary. I'm getting behind my ears. Who're you playing cards with, Mr. Krabs? Plankton?! But, Mr. Krabs, he's your arch-enemy! He's been trying to steal the Krabby Patty formula for years! Why would you play cards with him? Taking him to the cleaners! That's a hot one! How'd the card game go last night, Mr. Krabs? Barnacles, Mr. Krabs. How much money did you lose? Don't tell me you lost the Krusty Krab! Mr. Krabs, please tell me you didn't lose the Krabby Patty secret formula! What? Good one, Mr. Krabs. Well, I got to go make those Krabby Patties. Go on, Mr. Krabs. Tell him. Tell him all about your cruel, sick joke. But, Mr. Krabs, I don't wanna work for him! I wanna work for you here at the Krusty Krab! Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! What is this place? Actually, uh, Mr. Plankton, sir, I haven't, uh... The sign says "kitchen", but my heart says "jail". ♪A stove is a stove, no matter where you go.♪ ♪A grill is a grill, this is surely so,♪ ♪But this grill is not a home. This is not the stove I know.♪ ♪It's just a greasy spoon...♪  I'm sorry, Plankton, I've tried my best. I'm not used to cooking this way! Please don't take my brain out! Really?! Then I would like to go back to the Krusty Krab. Well, I usually cook on a grill. Uh, it's just that I'm used to the grill facing that way. A little more to the left. Move it over a little more. Keep going. Almost! That's it, just a little more...perfect! Right there! I don't know, it still doesn't feel right. It is an exact replica! Here's the sink, the greasy fryers, the squeaky floorboards, and that thing! One Krabby Patty coming up, Mr. Krabs! Oh...Mr. Krabs! Well...there is one thing I've always wanted... Wow! Well... Wait ‘til I finish my ice cream! Faster! Faster! Faster! All this preparation is making me hungry. Mmmm...I'm kind of in the mood for tacos. No, I don't really feel like it! Tell you what, half-pint: why don't you ask me later! No! Do ba da ma! Dee dee doodle dee dee doo. Response: Why don't you ask me later? Get welded. I don't wanna. My brain and I are glad to be back, Mr. Krabs. I don't feel like it! Why don't you ask me later, Krabby? I mean...I'll work all day for free! My treat! Okay. Ready, Patrick? One... Scissors beats paper, Patrick! One... Three! Patrick, how come you always do paper? It looks like a giant pencil. It is a giant pencil, Patrick! Let's draw some giant pictures with it. Stand back, Patrick! I can't draw with you breathing down my neck! It's a jellyfish. Eh, everybody's a critic. Now that's more like it, Mr. Critic! Do you know what this means, Patrick? It means we found a magic pencil! Coming right up! Be careful, Patrick! Being an artist is a heavy responsibility. Each work of art is like a child and must be treated as such. Okay! Why didn't you say so? Hey! Another jellyfish! It's kind of creepy looking when it moves. We can't let it go into town! Hey! My brain just hatched an idea. This is gonna be classic! Oh, Squidward! Wait! I've got another idea! This'll be the ultimate prank. I'll draw me, and when Squidward answers the door... it won't be me! Aww, look at him. Ain't he a doll? All he needs is a tie. Ready for action! He's knocking on the door. Squidward's answering the door and... DoodleBoy, stop! What have I done? We've got to find him! Where could he possibly be? Come on, let's go! Come on, Patrick. I'm right behind you. Baby steps. Almost there... Come on, Patrick. Give me a boost up! No way. I created this monster and I've got to stop him. See what I mean, Patrick? You okay, Patrick? There he is. Ahem. He's putting down the pencil! This is our chance. On the count of three, we'll jump out and surprise him! Patrick! Patrick! Do something! Hold it right there, Doodle. I brought you into this world and now I'm gonna take you out. Any last words? I'm sorry, what was that? Hold still, Doodle. This is for your own good. Take that and this and this and that and this that this that... I am SpongeBob, destroyer of evil! Well, that takes care of that, eh, Patrick? Gee, Gary, you should have been there! It sure was exciting, but you know, I kind of miss the little doodle. He was like a son to me. But I'm sure glad things are back to normal. Well, good night, sweet prince. Good night, magic pencil. Oh, hey, Magic Pencil. What are you doing up? Drawing yourself a glass of water? DoodleBob! No hard feelings, right? What do you think you're doing, doodle?! Be careful with that thing! Who knows what will happen? I nose. Very funny, doodle. Now it's my turn. Well, Doodle, it looks like this is a draw. You've made your point, no matter, I was voted most artistic in high school. Or maybe it was most clumsy. Huh? Paper! Page for Mr. Doodle! Take a look for yourself, Patrick. No, no, not evil. He was just a two-dimensional creature lost in our three-dimensional aquatic world longing for a purpose. Exactly! See how happy he is? O, great Magic Pencil, your powers are too mighty for us ocean dwellers. So I will send you back to the magic kingdom from where you came. Are you ready, Patrick? Patrick! Patrick! Oh, Patrick! Are you ready to go jellyfishing? Here's your net. Well, come on, Patrick! The jellyfish don't catch themselves. Secret box? You never told me about your... secret box! It's okay, Patrick, I know all about secrets. I've got a gazillion secrets! Well, it's not a secret that the best thing about a secret is secretly telling someone your secret, thereby secretly adding another secret to their secret collection of secrets. Secretly. You wanna hear one of my secrets? Uhh... Let's see... Did you know that you're my best friend? Okay. Uhh... Secretly... I'm a little bit naïve. Okay. I love my job at the Krusty Krab, I sleep with my shoes on, I like jelly on both sides of my toast, I've got an overdue library book, I think Jelly-Fishing and Bubble-Blowing are the… ...overbite. I've never been late for work, I've said the word "fancy" in conversation, I like to dance to loading zone announcements, I still don't have my driver's license. I'm a little bit on the short side. And I'm wearing three pairs of underwear, right now. Now will you show me what's inside your secret box? Oh, yeah?! Well, I got plenty of secret stuff, too! Uh… I've got my secret socks on. And my secret Gary's bowl! My secret TV! And my secret TV channel. What do you think of that, Patrick? Patrick? But, Patrick, I must know the secret! Come on, Patrick, just a peek? But... we're supposed to be... friends forever. I feel so filthy! I have soiled our friendship garden! I just couldn't help myself! I know it's your secret! I promise to respect that! Oh, please forgive me, Patrick! Please! So, what do you say, buddy? Friends? What could be in that box that Patrick doesn't want me to see? Maybe it's the world's only albino jellyfish! Or maybe Patrick's a master jewel thief and it's full of diamonds. Or maybe Patrick's a deranged maniac who keeps his victims' severed heads in a box. Or even worse! Maybe it's an embarrassing snapshot of me from the Christmas party! I've gotta find out what's in that secret box! I'm not gonna rest until I do! That's it! How do you look in a secret box? Secretly, of course! I'll just take the box while Patrick's sleeping, look in that box, and before Patrick even has time to notice, I'll slide it back. Patrick won't know when I'll have my own little secret. Good idea, eh, Gary? Oh, what do you know? You're a snail! I got to be more quiet. I don't want to wake Patrick up. Shhh! Gee, Patrick sure is a heavy sleeper. Uh… Wait, wait, wait, Patrick! Stop! It's me, SpongeBob! No, really, Patrick! Look! If it makes you feel any better, I haven't looked inside. Really? Okay! Oh, this is one the most exciting moments of my life! Well, here it goes! Huh? It's just a string. Boy, when you're right, you're right! That's some secret box you've got there! Yeah! Thanks for showing me that! Well, good night, Patrick. See you tomorrow! I should've known! It was just a piece of string all along! Wait 'till I tell Gary! Is this the part where we start kicking? No, people. Let's be smart and bring it off. What kind of monsters are we? That poor creature came to us in his hour of need, and we failed him. Squidward's always been there for us when it was convenient for him. Evelyn, when your little Jimmy was trapped in a fire, who rescued him? And Larry, when your heart gave out from all those tanning pills, who revived you? Right. So, if we can all just pretend that Squidward was a fireman, or some guy in an ambulance, then I'm sure that we can all pull together and discover what it truly means to be in a marching band. Now let's make Squidward proud. A 1, a 2, a skiddly diddly doo. We're ready to perform, Squidward. That's the spirit, Squidward! Maybe we're in one of those toxic waste dumps. ♪The winner takes all, it's the thrill of one more kill. The last one to fall will never sacrifice their will. Don't ever look back on the world closin' in. Be on the attack with your wings on the wind. Oh, the games will begin.♪ ♪And it's sweet, sweet, sweet victory, yeah. And it's ours for the taking, it's ours for the fight,♪ ♪And it's sweet, sweet, sweet victory, yeah. And the one who's last to fall. We will have sweet, sweet victory...♪ Wow! Now we never have to stop working! Isn't this great, Squidward?! Just you and me together for hours and hours and hours and then the sun'll come up and it'll be tomorrow and we'll still be working! It'll be just like a sleepover! Only we'll be sweaty and covered with grease! Are you ready to rock, Squidward?! Good! 'Cause we've got customers! Psst, Squidward. I'm working in the kitchen at night! Hey, Squidward. Guess what? I'm chopping lettuce...at night. Look at me, I'm swabbing the bathroom...at night. I burned my hand!...at night. Night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, na-na-na-na-night! Night! All right! Taking out the trash. Taking out the trash...at night. You mean outside? I don't know, Squidward, it's kinda dark out there. You're right! For the Krusty Krab! Piece of cake! Pfft, nah. What? What do I know? Tell me! Tell me! What happened, what happened, what happened!? The Slash-Bringing Hasher? The Sash-Ringing, the Trash-Singing, Mash-Flinging, The Flash-Springing, Ringing, The Cr-Crash-Dinging, daa. Tell me the story! He forgot the secret sauce? He didn't wash his hands? Irregular portions? You mean like this? Or like this? Or this? Or this? But what about this? Or this, or this, or this, or... So? Oh, no! Tuesday. But tonight's Tuesday night! How will we know? No. What? What? What, what, what does he do?! What? It's not? Ohhhhh. Isn't this great, Squidward? There's never time to wash the ceiling during the day. What? Hey, Squidward, how are you doing that without moving the switch? Nice try, Squidward. "The phone will ring and there will be no one there." Oh, you crack me up. I didn't know the buses ran this late. Well, they're dropping someone off. The Hash-Slinging Slasher! No, that's not it. I am just so touched that you would go through the trouble to dress up as a ghostly fry cook and stand on the other side of the street, just to entertain me! You must really like me!  He's going to flip me! Get away! Get away! Squidward, I used your clarinet to unclog my toilet! Get away! Get away! You're not welcome here! Do you have references? It's just a penny, sir. It doesn't matter. I see her, Mr. Krabs. A Krabby Patty with cheese. The classic. Hey! that's my driving teacher, Mrs. Puff! Oh, no, Mr. Krabs. She's single. She doesn't like to talk about it. Hey, I know! Why don't I take you over and introduce you? Oh, come on, Mr. Krabs! You look great. You wait here while I go break the ice. Hi, Mrs. Puff. Wait, Mrs. Puff! We're not driving. I work here, Mrs. Puff. Want to meet my boss? Don't move! Mrs. Puff, I'd like to introduce you to Mr... Mrs. Puff, I'd like to introduce you to my boss, Mr. Krabs. Psst! Mr. Krabs, say hello. No, no, Mr. Krabs. Just say hello. Wait. He's trying to tell you something. Oh! I think Mr. Krabs is saying that he'd like to... ...hit you with a rake! Try to guess your weight. No, wait. He wants to take you... ...on a date! Ready for your date, Mr. Krabs? Breath spray? Lucky hanky? Giant rusty anchor? Relax, Mr. Krabs. Just a little joke. Good luck with you know who. Mrs. Puff. I don't understand, Mr. Krabs. How can you spend $100,000 in one night? What are you gonna do? I wish there was some way I could help. I don't get it, Mr. Krabs. Nope. But you said... Mr. Krabs, I got the flowers you wanted me to buy. I got the flowers for Mrs. Puff. But you said... Mr. Krabs, the budget doesn't allow for... I bought the biggest box they had! Psst, Mr. Krabs, we're just going for a walk in the park, remember? Oh, I think she... As your financial advisor, I suggest... But... One shady hat. I'm trying, Mr. Krabs! But you keep telling me to buy things for Mrs. Puff! It's all really confusing. Wait! Don't tell me. You want me to run down to the store and buy Mrs. Puff something she doesn't need! Then you want me to run back here so you can say, "Arrgh, SpongeBob! You're spending all me money!" And then I'll say, "But Mr. Krabs, I'm only doing what you said!" Then you'll say, "We're not talking about this..." ..."Or this"... ..."we're talking about this!" Mr. Krabs, don't. Don't cry, Mr. Krabs! Come on. Okay, I, I'm going to get it, see? Cheer up, Mr. Krabs, Here's that washing machine you wanted. See?! You just did it again! Well, Mr. Krabs. Do you want to know what I think? Arrgh! Regga flebba breeka brecka smullen-ellen Mr. Krabs! Yegga hegga mergin wallet! Dimmy middy spend! Rivy flivy diva shiva Mr. Krabs Wallet! Did you hear that? We get an assignment! Did you hear that? What not to do at a stoplight? Yeah, I know! Okay, Gary, no goofing off! I am about to write the greatest essay of all time. Like most great essays, it will be written on paper. Even more important than the paper is the pencil. A pencil as sharp or as dull as I like. Hmm.. funny... as my ideas grow, you shrink. Well, I couldn't have asked for a more beautiful day to write an essay. Okay, here we go. What. Not. To do. At. A. Stoplight. Hey, this is easy! By SpongeBob SquarePants. Hah! This essay is pure gold! And now, pencil, get ready to do your stuff because here we go! Gee, this is harder than I thought... It should be against the law to have to write an essay on such a super sailorific, sunshiny day! Oh! But I must press onward, because with this pencil, and the completion of this essay, I'll be one step closer to my driver's license! Oh, yeah. This'll be no problemo. Why, I've got plenty of time. It's only 6:00! Okay, here we go, here we go. Bah! I know! I just need to get a little blood pumpin' in the old noodle. How about some calisthenics? I can feel those juices pumpin' now! Huh? What am I doing?! I've gotta write that paper! Come on, pencil, make words. Gary! Hey, hey, hey, Gary! How's my favorite mollusk? How about you let ol' SpongeBob fix you up something to eat? What do you mean you're not hungry? I know I have an essay to write! Now come on, Gary! I've got to make sure you have your nutrition, Gary, so I'm not leaving until you eat every single bite. Gary, are-are you sure you don't want some crème brulée? Or, or some chocolate-flavored algae bits? Gee, Gary sure made a mess. I can't work on my essay knowing there's a mess in the kitchen. Hmmm...I might as well clean the rest of the floor while I'm at it. I should get these hard-to-reach places, too! And these dishes need to be cleaned! Can't have dirty garbage. Well, I think it's clean enough now! Why that didn't take too long...and it's only...10:00! Ooh... No more fooling around! I've gotta get back to work! Okay, Mr. Essay, I say... prepare to be written! I'm doing it! I'm doing it! Yeah...yeah...yeah! And some of these, and some of these...Almost there and...done. Now let’s see how it looks so far. "The-" Break time! Pacing always helps me think! Let's see, only 799 words to go...think, SpongeBob, think! Hey, Patrick, whatchya up to? That's really fascinating, are you having a good sleep? Any dreams you'd like to discuss, I remember on the... That is-that is not true! I called to have an engaging conversation with you! Uh...Marco! Yeah, well I gotta get going, Patrick, got an important essay to write? Sheesh, what a chatterbox. Can't he see that I'm busy? I can't write with all these eraser shavings all over my paper! Now they're floating around my thinking space. So long, Pesky Particles! I swallowed one! I'm choking! Water, water! That was a close one. What do you mean 'overly dramatic?', Gary? All that choking sure made me hungry. I can't write on an empty stomach, Gary, I gotta have my brain food! Now let's see...White or rye bread...or pumpernickel. Gee, I guess it really depends on the meat inside... and the cheese A visitor? For me!? Hello! Great, thanks! So, uh, do you like delivering mail? Rye or pumpernickel? So, do you deliver your own mail or do you have your own mail person? But then who delivers his mail? Is there a never-ending chain of mailmen delivering mail to other mailmen? Well, I guess a P.O. box could in theory break the chain... How did he know I'm supposed to be writing an essay? Hi-yah! Oh no! Midnight! Must.. get... back to desk! Whew, that was a close call. Ah! My pants! You get up here! I've got to get back to work! Stop, Pants! You get back here this instant! Paaants...! Burning! No! What have I done?! Help! Help! My house is on fire! Huh!? Where's my essay? Oh, there you are! I must have dozed off. Let’s see, where are we? Do I dare look at the clock..? It's almost 9:00! Class starts in 5 minutes! How am I going to write this whole paper in 5 minutes?! How am I supposed to know what to do at a stoplight? Feeding your snail is something not to do at a stoplight... And... making a sandwich, and lighting candles, and drinking water, and calling your friends, and karate chopping the TV, and shootin' the breeze with the mailman, and fallin' asleep... Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff! I'm finished! All 800 words! I'm finished! Here it is! Huh? Mrs. Puff? Where is everybody? Here you go, Mrs. Puff! 800 words! All about stoplights and what not to do at 'em. But what about my essay? Patrick, what's with the home improvement? Hey, Patrick! Well, Patrick, I came over to see if you wanted to go jellyfishing. But I can see you're busy having an episode. But, Patrick, the only thing I've ever seen you clean is your plate. Patrick! You forgot how to eat again! Come on, we'll get the funnel. Darn, I like the funnel. Well, what is it, then? Hey, a note! You're right! Your parents? "Dear Patrick, your mom and I are coming out tomorrow for Starfish Day. Please try to remember, but don't try too hard, or you'll hurt yourself like last time. Love, Daddy." No, they don't, Patrick. Parents just like to push your buttons. Like this! Nauuugh! Patrick, if your parents think you're dumb, then they must not know what dumb really is. That's what I'm saying, Pat! If your parents got to meet a real dummy, they'd realize what a genius you really are! Don't worry, Patrick! I'll be the dummy! When your parents see how dumb I act, they'll think you're the smartest guy ever! Protective helmet, check. I'm supposed to look stupid, Gary! What could go wrong? Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hey, Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, meet me in the kitchen! Patrick, could you let up on the insults just a little bit? Patrick, I get the feeling that you think I really am dumb! I'm only pretending to be dumb! It was our plan, remember?! Okay, I will! I have a confession to make. I lied about being stupid. I just acted like a fool so you would appreciate Patrick a little bit more. I know how to talk, and eat, and do laundry. I even separate the darks from the lights. So what do you say we start over and try again? Hi! My name is SpongeBob SquarePants. And I am not a dummy. But... but, but, but, but, but, but... Now, listen to me! I'm not dumb! I have a brain! See? Here's a picture of it! No! It's normal size and fully functional, watch. 2 plus 2 equals 4. Noooo!  Well, see you in the A.M., Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs, you shouldn't talk about Squidward like that! Takin' out the trash, takin' out the trash. Hmm... dumpster writing! The voice of the people! "Up with bubbles, down with air!" "Nematodes are people too!" Ha, those nematodes... Here's one someone didn't finish! Squidward smells. Good. Hmm, what's this one? Krabs is a... hmm? Krabs is a . Well, sometimes, but not... Recently. Hi, Patrick! Hey, Patrick, do you know what this word means? Nah-uh, not that word, that word. Sentence enhancers? Oh, I get it! Let me try. Hello, Patrick. Lovely day we're having, isn't it? How right you are, Patrick! Ooh, You're right, Patrick, my lips are tingling from the spiciness of this conversation. It tingles when I laugh! Hello, customers, nice day we're having, uh? Hey, Patrick, how the are ya? Attention, customers, today's special is a Krabby Patty served in a greasy sauce and grilled to perfection. And don't forget to ask us to the fries. It will be our pleasure. Hi, Squidward, how the are ya? But, Mr. Krabs, we were only using our sentence enhancers. You mean ? Wow, 13. Gee, I'm glad Mr. Krabs told us that word we were using was a bad word! Yeah, verily. Now, let's play a nice, wholesome game of Eels and Escalators. Come on, Gary needs a new pair of shoes! Darn. Come on, escalators, escalators, escalators! Eels again. Escalators, Escalators, Escalators! Eels? Escalators, escalators, escalators! Ha! Escalators! Ah, ! I didn't mean... you gotta understand, Patrick, I was trying...what I meant to say was...some things just slip out. You gotta understand! No, wait, Patrick! Patrick, no, please don't tell! Aha! Now I'm gonna tell Mr. Krabs on you! I can run faster than you! Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs! Patrick, Patrick, Patrick! He said, he said, he said! Me and Patrick were playing Eels and Escalators, and Patrick was going up-up-up, and I had to ride the eel and then we ran and Patrick, he said some things. Well, he said... Well, uh, let's just say he said a certain word that you said we shouldn't say, and this particular word happens to be number 11 in the 13 words you said shouldn't be said. ...number thirteen... We'll probably get 40 lashes! I'm sorry, Patrick. Mr. Krabs was right. There's no need for words like that. Let's make a vow, Patrick. From this day forth, a foul word shall never pass our lips! We'll be good citizens, just like good ol' Mr. Krabs. Five, six, seven... That's all thirteen, Patrick! We're gonna tell your mom, Mr. Krabs! Mama Krabs, he said and then he said again and said and then he screamed at the top of his voice ! And he-- --Mrs. Krabs, he didn't care! Such a stream of I have never heard in my days! Hi, Squidward! Are you taking this art class, too? This is great! You and me in school together. So, where's the teacher? You are the teacher? To my pupil? This isn't art class, it's Heaven. I'm ready, Mr. Tentacles. Yes, please. I have no talent. Mr. Tentacles has all the talent. If I'm lucky, Mr. Talent will rub his tentacles on my art. How's this, Squidward? Well, first I draw this head. Then I erase some of the more detailed features. And one, two, three. A circle, uhh, thingy. Ooh, nice one Squidward. Let me try. Looky, Squidward. It's you and me playing leapfrog. That's you on the bottom. I call it: Rippy Bits. You take a bunch of old ripped of paper, and make a new picture out of it. See? You're on top...this...time. I'm sorry, Squidward, I'll listen. How's this Squidward? Ohhh, it's so obvious. I would've never thought of that. I'm sorry, Squidward. I came here to learn and I arrogantly shoved your lessons. I'll never be a great artist like you! I don't deserve your tutoring. I don't deserve to be in your presence. I don't even deserve to use your doors! But I did deserve that. I deserved that, too. And I deserve this! Go away, Squidward. I don't deserve your kindness. Don't look at me Squidward. Don't look at my shame. These hands weren't meant to create. They only destroy. I can't look at them. Really? Really? Really? Wow. Really? Squidward, look. It's ol' Bold and Brash! I... can't! I did it, Squidward. I don't know, Squidward. That stuff's not in the book. That's not in the book, either. Wait, I know this. Oh, wait, I think I got it. Ta-da! First, an artist must concentrate and visualize his concept. I've gotta embrace the marble! I've gotta sniff the marble! I've gotta lick the marble! I've gotta wash the marble! I've gotta date the marble! I've gotta be the marble! I've got it! I have see the sculpture within. With this tool, I shall give birth to art. But, one more thing. There. Now it's art. Well, what do you think, Squidward? Just take it all in for a moment. Let it soak in. It looks like the excitement of my artistic triumph is too much for Squidward. Oh, well, back to the dump. ♪To the dump, to the dump, to the dump, dump dump. To the dump, to the dump, To the dump, dump dump. ♪ Gotcha! Barnacles! How'd he do that? Someday, I'll catch old No Name. I'm going on my lunch break, Mr. Krabs. Wow! One more minute than yesterday! SpongeBob ready for lunch! Yum! Why, this is a hole, Good sir. You see, I am a sponge, And we typically... It's just a little ol' Krabby Patty with Jellyfish Jelly! I call it a Krabby Patty with Jellyfish Jelly. Sure! No one, Mr. Krabs. I was just sharing my jellyfish jelly with the customers. Here you go, Mr. Krabs. Send your taste buds on a journey. You okay, Mr. K? Oh, boy. Getting paid to jellyfish. That's my life's dream! Aye, aye, sir! But, sir, how many jellyfish do you need? No! Never! Okay, Mr. Krabs. Just make sure the jellyfish are comfortable. They are oh, so sensitive. Here you go, Mr. Krabs! More jellies, Mr. Krabs! Well, there's no more! Now, that's jellyfishing! It feels like somebody... wants to sell me something! I'm not interested in anything you're selling! I sure felt like... I must be working too hard. I'll get it, Gary! Hello, SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob speaking. Hello? Wrong number. I guess Gary forgot to pay the electric bill! Gary, is that you? Gary? Uh, yeah, good idea, Gary, there's probably some candles in the kitchen. Hello, what's this? What are you doing here, oh delicious one? A little snack will calm my nerves! Mmm... a Krabby Patty with blue jelly. Blue jelly?! Hey, old No Name? What's happening? No Name, let me out! What are you gonna do with me? Pee-yew! What smells like big business? Hey, I don't remember that factory! Huh? What is this horrible place? What kind of monster is responsible for this horror? Mr. Krabs? No! Now I know why you brought me here. But what can we do? Mr. Krabs! Stop this madness! Stop it right now! Oh, boy! A tea party! You tricked me, Mr. Krabs! I wouldn't have collected all those jellyfish if I knew that this was their fate! This isn't right! Jellyfish need wide-open space and fresh air! Something that should've been done a long time ago! The squeaky bolt on this door was driving me crazy! And now, I'm gonna set these jellyfish free! Freedom! Freedom! Goodbye, friends! He really got burned on that deal! All is as it should be. I promise never to use this jellyfish net for anything but pure sport again. Jellyfish aren't meant to be captured forever! Oh, No Name! I guess I can name you now. I'll call you... "Friend." This is perhaps the greatest day of my young life, Mr. Krabs. I can't believe I'm representing the Krusty Krab in the Fry Cook Games. To bring home the gold is to bring honor and glory to the Krusty Krab. Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Hi, Patrick. Come on, Patrick, I'm trying to train for the games. Ah, sorry, Patrick. You have to be a fry cook. What do you mean easy? They don't let just anybody be a fry cook. We're an elite corp! Hey, flipping is not as easy as it sounds! Why don't you go home, Patrick? You can compete in the Laying Under a Rock All Day Games! You take that back! You don't even have fingernails. How can you hear it? You don't have ears either! Cone head! Pink! Fine! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Patrick, what are you doing here? You're not a fry cook. Well, it doesn't matter anyway, 'cause you're gonna eat my dust. Not if I eat it first! Pink! I can't believe it, Mr. Krabs. I thought Patrick was my friend. What do you mean? He is? No! I'm angry!  For the Krusty Krab! Make way for the real fry cook, Patrick. I scream for ice cream! Top that, Pinky. Laugh while you can, Pinky. It's not over yet. I don't like you! I never liked you! Pink! Yellow? Let's promise never to fight again, buddy. You too, Patrick. Over and under, grab the end, put it through here, up and around, round the horn, bring it back home. I can't accept your money, Mr. Krabs. Grilling is my passion! 18... 19... and... 20. Here you go, Mr. K. I think this should cover all my nonsense. Oh, and here's an extra fifty cents for when I was tying my shoe. I'm just giving Mr. Krabs the money I owe him. Why? Wow! You and me go on strike? Right! Right! Right! Yay! A strike! ♪Goin' on a strike! We’re goin' on a strike!♪ I still don't know what a strike means. ♪But we're goin' on a strike!♪ Hey, guess what, Mr. Krabs? Me and Squidward are going to go on strike! Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah! Yeah! Noo... No! Squidward! You didn't tell me I was gonna get fired! Without the Krusty Krab, I-I-I... Oh, Squidward, could you hold me? I think I'm gonna be sick. Sorry. And more? I can't do it, Squidward. This hat is my friend! It never oppressed me. Like this, Squidward? How's this? How about this, Squidward? At the Krusty Krab. Krusty Krab is unfair! Mr. Krabs is in there! Standing at the concession! Plotting his oppression! I don't know. Squidward told me to yell it at people. Yep! Anything for an aspiring fry cook. So, did you come down to help out the cause? I'm sorry, Squidward. How about I try the signs again? Like this, Squidward? Gee, I don't know what Squidward's talking about, but he sure sounds convincing. That was a great speech, Squidward. You practically had them eating out of your hands. Alright, Mr. Krabs. You've gone too far this time. You can pick on me, but Squidward is a great leader. We are workers united! We're tired of your smelly greed! And we're gonna saw all your tables, and we're gonna smash stuff with the people's hammer. And we're gonna... we're gonna... Squidward, what was that other part? Yeah, that, too! And me and Squidward are gonna stay on strike until we get what we deserve! Even if it takes forever! Hey, Squidward. I bet old man Krabs is gonna break any day. Eh, Squidward? Eh, Squidward? Nyeh, Squidward? Nyeh, Squidward? Nyeh, Squidward? Nyeh, Squidward? Gee, being on strike with Squidward sure is a kick. Squidward's words are still buzzing around in my head like an angry jellyfish. Squidward was right! I can't just sit here, it's time for action! I will restore the working man to his rightful glory. I will dismantle this oppressive establishment board by board! I will saw the tables of tyranny in half. Gnaw at the ankles of big business! Squidward will be so proud! I did exactly as you said, Squidward. I dismantled the establishment! Now we'll get our jobs back for sure. Here it comes! Ya-hoo! The strike worked, Squidward! We got our jobs back! Forever! Two soups, please. Thank you. You keep the change. What? I saw it! It was big! It was all wiggly! And it ate everything! It was an Alaskan... Bull... Worm! What? But, Sandy, you don't know what you're up against. We're talking about an Alaskan... Bull... Worm! But, Sandy, you don't know! Sandy! Sandy! Wait! Sandy! Sandy, don't go! Sandy, I saw it! It's big... scary... and pink! You'll get massacred! Okay, but what if the worm didn't take your tail? Um, I do? Um... in my pocket. No, it's not. This is your tail. How would you know?! It's always behind you! Oh, don't go, don't go, don't go! Oh, yeah? What if I said... 'blargen-fezibble-nukhip'? You know, tails are so overrated. Let's just forget about it and go home. I've got ice cream! With nuts... Sandy, this is your pappy speaking, and I forbid you to go after this worm! Y'all come back here, young lady! Sandy, if you want to get to that worm, you're gonna have to go through me! Sandy, no! I can't let you! I'm not gonna let you get killed. If you find him, you'll get eaten for sure! No, not tough enough. Not tough enough! You are. You did. You do. Okay. There isn't anything... Ain't nothin' too big or too ornery for you to catch. But... But... And... We... I... Yeah but... You see... I... Sandy, are you sure you...? Sandy, that's not...! Sandy, that's not...! Sandy! Sandy...? That's not the worm. That's not the worm. That's his tongue. So what's the plan, Sandy? I could've thought of that. Hey, wait a minute! I was right, wasn't I?! Ah, he is too big for you, isn't he? I wanna hear you say it! Say it! Say it, or I'll trip you! Say it! Say it! I knew it. Uh, Sandy? What do we do now? I'm way ahead of you, Sandy. Look, it's a necklace! S for "SpongeBob" or S for "Sandy"! That way they can identify our bodies. Yay! He'll never get out of there! Yay! Let's go tell everybody! Order up! Two deluxe Krabby Patties. There you are, sir. Two deluxe... Ahoy there, Mr. Plankton. Yes, sir! I'm afraid you can't do that, Mr. Plankton! Because that Patty is for the customer, sir! But you can take these Patties, sir. I made them in the off chance that you'd decide to instigate some bun inspection today, Mr. Plankton, sir! Well, it's just that it's Tuesday again, sir, and I was wondering if I could have my, um... weekly performance review! Oh, yes, please, sir, please! Oh, please, sir! I want to make you so happy and proud! But, sir! But, sir, there's gotta be something I need to improve on. ANYTHING!!! Wh-what? Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh... Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh... Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh... A pro- a promo- a promotion?! Register! It's okay, Squidward. I'm official, look! Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah... Hey, Squidward, I can see you through this little window! I tried, Mr. Plankton. I really did. A customer ordered a medium soda, and I gave him a large! I gave him a large! I've soiled the good Krusty Krab name! No, sir, he's back. Man your stations! Red alert! Red alert! Take cover! He's around here somewhere. There he goes! He's the most hated creature in Bikini Bottom. It's your arch competitor, Krabs. His goal in life is to steal a Krabby Patty and ruin our restaurant. Yeah! But the worst part is... I'm gonna make you eat those words, Krabs! No shirt, no shoes... no service!!!! Knick-knack, the Patty's back! You did it, Mr. Plankton. Victory screech! You'll never get this formula, you twisted fiend! Phone call, Mr. Plankton. What a beautiful day. Can you believe that sun? Uhh, Patrick? Nothing. I don't know. Let me check. Looking good. How's yours? Hey, it's Larry, the lifeguard. What a guy. Is it any wonder he's so popular? Just imagine... if I were a lifeguard. That would be so cool. Who needs to be a lifeguard? I'm cool. I'm every bit as cool as Larry. And if I'm not, let me be struck by... ...a flying ice cream truck. And live! Lifeguard? White stuff. You think I'm a lifeguard? You really think so? (high voice) I'd love it! Hi. It works. Woohoo! That was the greatest, Larry. By myself? I'm not just ready. I'm ready, Freddie. Action? But I... ...can't swim. Oh, if I'd known being a lifeguard meant guarding their lives, I would never have said yes. Maybe nothing will go wrong. Then when Larry comes back, I'll tell him I'm not interested. Besides, what’s the worst that could happen? Emergency! Everybody out of the water! Hurry! Emergency! Out of the water! Emergency! Uhh... there are sharks in there! Uhh... sea monster! Uhh, somebody went? No, don't go! Free ice cream! Plenty for everybody. One for you, one for you... okay, everybody got one? A-ha, now I got ya! Now, you all have to wait one hour before you go swimming. But just so you're not tempted... Ladies and gentlemen, uh, the lagoon is closed. Does Larry ever give you free ice cream? Oh, no, that's not possible. The lagoon is closed. If there was anyone in there, we'd hear them. Somebody would be screaming that they're drowning. They would have to have crossed the line. Okay, I'll take a look, but just to prove to you that... ...Patrick isn't drowning! Hold on, Patrick! I'm coming! Don't move! Catch this! Oh, what am I going to do? Got to think. Gotta think. Gotta run around and think. Gotta run around and think at the same time. Gotta think, gotta have a plan. Gotta think, think, think. I've got it! Patrick can't drown if there isn't any water. Well, you're safe now, Patrick. Sorry. Here's your hot dog. Okay, Patrick, here I come. Come, come round, Pat. Here I am. Goodbye, Patrick! Yes, Larry? No, Larry. Wey, wook. It's Widward! Widward's woing to work. We can't tell you 'cause you're not a member of the club. Sorry, Squidward, but you couldn't get in even if you tried! I don't know. Something about his nose? We've been stuck up here for three days. Well, since you're here, Squidward, we'll give you the new member initiation. Are you ready, Patrick? Oh, cheer up, Squid. It could be worse. No, it's not, Squidward. Come on, guys, we're gonna be fine! As long as we stick together. Remember, we're a club! And besides, we have this! Magic Conch Shell, will I ever get married? Squidward, we must never question the wisdom of the Magic Conch. The club always takes its advice before we do anything. Oh, Magic Conch Shell, what do we need to do to get out of the Kelp Forest? It's a gift from the Magic Conch. Squidward? Once a member, always a member! Why don't you ask... the Magic Conch, Squidward? Squidward, are you questioning the authority of the Magic Conch? The conch is the one who gave us this banquet. This copyrighted conch is the cornerstone of our organization. Squidward, are you all right? I'd better call the doctor, 'cause I've got spring fever! Good morning, little flowers. Hello, Squidward, isn't it a lovely day? Have you said hello to the flowers yet? Gosh, I didn't know Squidward had hay fever. I'll do him the kindness and plant him some hypoallergenic flowers. You're on your way. I bet you're thirsty. Huh? I'm not taking my eyes off you. Hi, Patrick! How does this keep happening? Hi. She's beautiful! What a magnificent seahorse. I shall tame her. Who knows what we can accomplish? Because of her mysterious behavior, I have decided to name her Mystery. Hmmm, now that I think of it, she is very graceful and majestic. Perhaps I should name her Grace, or Majesty, or Debbie. She must have spotted my floral bookmark! She's coming this way. That's it, girl. Don't be afraid. I'm just a talking sponge, is all. Gosh, Mystery, that was the greatest day of my life. Do you think we'll be friends forever? I'll take that as a yes! Hey, Squidward! Still riding a machine to work, I see! Whoa, girl. Now you wait out here until I'm done with work. See you at the end of my shift. That's not a monster, Mr. Krabs, it's a horse. She's my friend. Her name is Mystery. Huh? Please, Mr. Krabs, let her stay! She won't hurt nobody nohow! I knew I should've named her Debbie. You're welcome, Mr. Krabs. Good one, sir. Ha! It worked, girl! We'll just keep you here until Patrick finishes that stable I asked him to build. Only eight more hours. No, Mystery, you can't come out yet. If old man Krabs sees you, I'll lose my job. Wait a second. I bet you're hungry. How ‘bout some lunch? Shhh! Girl, you got to be quiet or... No, Mr. Krabs. I was just practicing my imitation of Mystery. Weesnaw. That was close. From now on, no more hijinks. Order up! Did you look under the tray? They vanished. Squidward, do you think the Krusty Krab is haunted? What if they come for me next? I gotta get out of here! Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I hear you Squidward. I'll be right back. Don't tell Mr. Krabs! I got it all under control! Now then, you were saying? You got it, Squidward? Ghosts. Mystery, you ate my hat! Mystery, you ate my spatula! You ate all the Krabby Patties! You ate the stove! You ate Old Man Jenkins! Mystery got a belly-ache from eating Krabby Patties, so I made her a bicarbonate of soda. No, Mr. Krabs! Don't make me give up Mystery! I know you think she's just a horse, but she's more than that, I tell you. She listens to me. She understands everything I say and I understand her! She's my best friend! You do? What happened to the dollar, Mr. Krabs? Alright, Mr. Krabs, I understand. Okay, girl, you're free to go. I can't keep you anymore. I know it's hard for you to understand, but Mr. Krabs is right. You belong in the wild. Well, what are you waiting for? Can't you see I don't want you anymore? Just get out of here, you stupid, dumb animal! Well, she's gone and I'll never see her again. Mystery! Mystery! Weesnaw! Good one, Squidward. Like you don't know. Saying, "I hate Krabby Patties." That's hilarious! Everyone loves Krabby Patties. You're good at that. Hey, everyone! Squid says he doesn't like Krabby Patties. Ha! Sorry, Squidward, it's just so funny. You know what we say. What? What? What did you say? I'm sorry... I don't... Those words. Is it possible to use them in a sentence together like that? Never had a Krabby Patty?! Well, you've got to have one right now! No wonder you're always so miserable! Here, try this. If you try it, you'll love it! Sorry, Patrick. Come on, you're gonna— Open up the tunnel, here comes the train. Choo-choo... Whoop! What's that in your ear? Come on, open wide! But it's good for you! No, Squidward, I meant... good for your soul. Okay, just half. A quarter? One bite? Just smell it. Come on, Squidward. One bite. You won't be sorry. It's delicious... Ahhhhh... Eeeeee.... Oooooh-oooooh-oooh... But— But, it doesn't make any sense. The Krabby Patty is an absolute good. Nobody is immune to its tasty charms. Are you sure? No. I didn't think it was possible, but, I guess some people just don't like Krabby Patties. Yes, Squidward? Coming right up! Listen, Squidward. I want to apologize for before. I was only trying to make you happy. But I guess deep down inside, I was trying to make myself happy, but now I've learned there's room for all kinds of people in this crazy old ...and they all don't have to like the same things. ...And while I strongly disagree with your decision, I accept it. You know, it's not often I get to make one like this. I want to see the look on their face when they take that first bite. Triple Krabby Supreme! Triple Krabby Supreme! Did somebody order a Triple Krabby Supreme? Huh, they must've left. Noooope, a patty this special should be eaten fresh, and... well... I haven't had one of these babies in over twenty minutes, so... Well, whoever they were, they had great taste! Ahh, they don't know what they're missing. Well, back to work! Oh no, what's this doing here?! This patty should be cremated! I know you didn't like him, but... it means so much that you came. , having a child with the patty, and growing old with it. Dream sequence ends] Squidward? Is that you? I always come to work at 3:00 A.M. This is when I count the sesame seeds. What are you doing here? And why is the patty vault open? And why are you holding a patty behind your back? And why are you acting so nervous? And why are you sweating so much? And why do you look so hungry? And... You like Krabby Patties, don't you, Squidward? I knew it all along, Squidward. No one can resist a Krabby Patty! Squidward! How many are you eating? Squidward! Squidward, you can't eat all those patties at one time! Squidward! No, worse, it'll go right to your thighs...! ...and then you'll blow up! Excuse me, miss? I was just wondering... ...is it the homework pencil on the left side of the paper next to the quiz pencil, or over on the right side all by itself? Or... Wait, I got it! The quiz pencil goes right over here next to the essay pencil and the essay pencil gets turned sideways toward the notepad, just in case I have to write an essay. Hi, I'm SpongeBob! That joke was almost funnier the second time. That time it almost seemed like... ...you really did mean it. Mrs. Puff? Can I be excused for the rest of my life? Yes, Mrs. Puff. Sorry, Mrs. Puff. I just don't understand. Why would Flats want to kick my butt? I haven't said two words to the guy! One, two,oh no, that's three! What am I going to do? What was that? Someone's coming. They're getting closer. I've just got to act natural. Phew, I thought for sure that was gonna be... Flats! Uh, hello, sir. Kick any good butts lately? Yeah, I remember last week, I was kicking this guy's butt real good. And he leans over and says, 'Hey, you know, life's like a bucket of wood shavings. Except for when the shavings are in a pail, then it's like a pail of wood shavings! Really? What's it say? ...and I leave Gary's water bowl to Gary, and my curtains to... oh Neptune, I just can't do this. Death row, next in line speaking. Patrick? Is that you? Patrick, listen! It's me, SpongeBob! I need your help! What? No, listen! I'm in big trouble. There's a new guy at school here and he wants to kick my butt! Listen, you're big and strong, do you think you could come down here and maybe rough him a bit? Just to get him off my back? Please, Patrick, I'm so scared, it feels like I'm gonna throw up. Patrick, you there? Mrs. Puff, can I be in a different class? I can't tell you. I just can't, Mrs. Puff. My physical being is at stake, let's just leave it at that. Well, okay. But only if you promise to keep it between us. Flats says he's going to kick my butt! Aw, thanks Mrs. Puff. I knew I could count on you. Yes, Mrs. Puff. You what?! I've got diarrhea! Huh? Are you Flats' dad? Okay, see, I didn't know where else to turn! Patrick couldn't help me, and Mrs. Puff only made it worse. I sit next to your son Flats in school, and he is a fine boy and all, and I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but he wants to kick my butt. Out of my way! Out of my way! Can't you see he's gonna kick my butt?! Okay, okay, I got to skip town, start a new life, live under an assumed name! "BobPants SpongeSquare". Yeah, that's good. Grow a beard, and then shave it off, and live happily ever after. Hey Flats, you feeling better? Yeah. They said you'd be okay after the first few minutes, but I just wanted to be sure. He's still gonna kick my butt! Oh Gary, I'm too young to have my butt kicked! There are so many things in life I haven't gotten to do! Hang on, I'll transfer your call. Who is it? Flats! Gary, there's something I want you to know, but I'm too scared to remember what it is. Go away, Gary. I don't want you to see this. It'll be ugly. Hold on. Okay, I'm ready. I said I'm ready. Didn't you hear me? I said I'm ready. That tickles. Gary, I'm absorbing his blows like I was made of some kind of spongy material! Do you known what that means? I get to go to work tomorrow! Flats, are you okay? Do not cheer me, my fellow adult classmates. Flats was the real victim here. A victim of a society that's riding down a violent road to nowhere; a road I call... ...'violence road'. But, Mr. Krabs, there's no reason to worry. The Krusty Krab is the most perfect place in the universe. What can I get for you...handsome? Excellent choice, my darling. Coming right up! He wants one of everything. Try the Krusty Kelp Dog, sir! The Powdered Driftwood is exquisite. More Diet Red Tide? And did the voluptuous inspector enjoy his meal? He says if he gets one more Krabby Patty, he'll pass us for the inspection! Maybe we oughta tell our guy about the phony impostor. Duped! We've been smeckledorfed! I bet he bites whale bubbles. It doesn't seem right... ...but it feels so good! Seahorse radish: the gnarliest stuff in the ocean. Oops, I dropped it in the toilet! I call it the 'Nasty Patty'. Here you go, sir, enjoy. Phew, that's a relief, eh, Mr. Krabs? I'm sure our guy will understand if we just explain the situation. Then we can all have a good laugh about it. Why, sir? Mr. Krabs, what are we gonna do? But you told me to give it to him! You're right, Mr. Krabs, I'm guilty. I'll never survive in prison, they'll mop up the floor with me. Eww, gross, germs, it's all icky and corpse-y! Eww...eww... Yes, sir. There's a big rock in the way! Aye aye, sir! What do you mean, Mr. Krabs? Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I thought he might need some air. Shouldn't we say a few words on his behalf? What a brave man, going in the line of duty like that. Why...why...why?! Mr. Krabs, I'm too young to go to jail! Can I lose my cool now? Oh, Neptune! Get away! Ooh...ahh-ahh... A-hem... Okay! All set back here. Nothing unusual about a muddy shovel in the trunk. Ahh... I understand, Mr. Krabs, but what do you want me to do with the bo... Oh, man, this is so gross! The back door is locked! What am I gonna do?! Well, the back door was locked, so I came around here...eh. So if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go put my hat in the freezer now. The dark deed you requested is done, sir. What? You can't pin this whole rap on me! It was all Mr. Krabs' idea. He wears curlers to bed! It's the zombie! Hey, Mr. Krabs, look. We passed the inspection! See anything yet, Patrick? That's me! Thank you! Thirty more seconds, Patrick. Easy... easy... Pretty smart, huh? Squidward, we don't need a television. Not as long as we have our... ...imagination! With... ...imagination, I can be anything I want! A pirate! Arrrrr! A football player! Hup! Sure, Squidward. Okay, Squidward, but if you change your mind, we'll be in this box! Let's go for it! Gloves! Hats! Underwear! Okay, Patrick, climb up there and secure this rope. Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, you're going too high! Take it easy, Patrick, you've got to acclimate! Patrick? Patrick? Patrick! I think we should keep our voices down! We might start an avalanche! I said, I think we should keep our voices down in case of avalanches! Our voices! Hang in there buddy, the chopper's on the way! No, Patrick, I can't do that! Because I already cut off my own arms! What noise, Squidward? First we establish a base camp at 15,000 feet... And... ...imagination. Squidward's such a jerk. Where's what, Squidward? We don't have a tape recorder, Squidward! But we don't! Welcome aboard, Squidward! You've just set sail on the S.S... ...Imagination... where our only destination is fantastic adventure! Where do you want to go first? Squidward, don't you see? Waiting and watching? That's not what the box is all about! It's about... ...imagination. Okay, Squidward! Robot Pirate Island it is! Arr. Ahoy matey! For that you'll walk the plank! I still can't believe those pirates beat all those robots. Good night, Patrick. Listen to that, Gary. Squidward finally made the box work after all. That's so great. Hey, our box is gone! I know! Let's go see Squidward! Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy? Must... get... autograph! Autograph! Can I have your autograph, can I have your autograph, can I... they're gone. Mermaid Man's belt! Hey, guys! Wait up! I've got something for you... You forgot your belt! You forgot— Mermaid Man's secret utility belt. The emblem of submersible justice! For 65 years, this belt has helped prevent the fall of nations... and pants. I can't believe I'm actually holding it in my hands. Well, I guess I should return it. Or not. I could just hang onto it till after work... all alone with Mermaid Man's belt. I wonder what this button does. Whoa. The small ray. There you go. Come again, sir. I don't know. Nothing. Nothing. No, no! Yes. Me, uh... either. Please don't tell! Please don't tell! Squidward, if Mermaid Man finds out, he'll kick me out of his fan club for sure! Please don't tell! Don't! No! Do-o-o-n't! I'm begging you! I'm sorry, Squidward, but you made me do it! Uh... uh, okay, uh... Uh... Uh... Uhh, I can do it! No! I can't let you do that! But there must be someone else who can help! Someone smart and wise, with years of life experience. Patrick! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, I was at work, and Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy came, and I got this belt, and look. No, Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, no! That's not an action figure! That's the real Squidward! I shrunk him by accident. Wait, you don't understand! This is serious! I don't know how to unshrink him! He could be stuck like this for the rest of his life. You think so? Oh, if only I knew how to work this thing! What? Patrick, I don't think Wumbo is a real word. Patrick, I'm sorry I doubted you. Oh no! Patrick, I'm not giant, you shrunk too! No! He can never find out! But I'll think of something. I promise. Until then, you'll be safe in this jar. It's only two people no big deal, nobody else saw it. Sandy! I'm sorry, Sandy! Mermaid Man came in and... Whoo! I'm gonna have to get a bigger jar. Oh, Squidward, he'll be so disappointed. You don't understand! Mom? Mermaid Man? I'm so sorry, it's just that I'm such a big fan, and your belt, and... I've got it! Ta-da! Since I couldn't make you big, I made the city small! And now, only one more thing to shrink. Cheese! I'm driving, Mrs. Puff! This is the one! This is the one! Come, on SpongeBob! Think! Think! Uhh... Turn that way! Turn that way! D'oh! Turn that way! Right! Left! Oh no! No! Come on, don't ever do that! Come on! No! I'm ready! I can do this, Mrs. Puff! I can do it! I can do it! Wait, I can do this, Mrs. Puff, I can do this! Gotta pass the test! Gotta pass! This must be the night driving part of the test. Hey, look at all those police! I wonder if the president's in town. Hi, I'm SpongeBob SquarePants. That depends, did I pass? Class just isn't the same without Mrs. Puff. Just the thought of her alone and afraid in jail makes me think about her being alone and afraid in jail. I don't know how she's going to survive. Oh, that poor woman. And it's all my fault. Maybe if I go talk to Patrick, he can ease my guilt. Oh, you're right! Mrs. Puff's in jail and it's all because of me! I'm such a barnacle head! Poor Mrs. Puff. I know, I gotta get her out! But to get her out of jail, first we gotta get in jail. Alright, put the money in the bag! Put it in! Alright, give me the money! Uhh, savings. Sure. Here ya go. Oh. Well, that went better than expected. Don't worry, Patrick, we'll get into jail this time. Look, Patrick, there she is! Mrs. Puff, wait, it's us, SpongeBob and Patrick! SpongeBob. It's me, SpongeBob. We're gonna bust you out of here. C'mon, Mrs. Puff! Darn it! Okay, Patrick, let's get out of here. No, wait! There goes our deposit on these costumes. Mrs. Puff, it's me, SpongeBob! No, it's really me! I brought Patrick along too. 'Cause we're gonna set you free! He likes chili. Now quick, get in before someone sees. That's a good one, Mrs. Puff. Now hop in. Come on! Oh, that's crazy, Patrick. But why? Excuse us for just one second, Mrs. Puff. Patrick, she has lost it! She's completely institutionalized. She's forgotten what it's like to live on the outside. To not be in prison. We've got to remind her that there is a life other than this. Mrs. Puff, if you come with us, I'll stay after school and decorate the whole classroom. Quick, Mrs. Puff, hop on! Psst! Hop in, Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff, up here. Made of sponge! I can pass the test, Mrs. Puff! I can pass the test! No! What are you doing? Help! Help! No, no, please! I have a snail to feed! I can't go to jail now! This is not a good time! No, please, please! I'm not a criminal! Whoopee! Oh, really, Patrick? Did the snowball look like this? Patrick, I threw it. We're having a snowball fight. Don't you get it? Well, first, you have to make a snowball. Sure, pal. Patrick! How could you? Oh yeah. Squidward! You're just in time to enlist in my army! Join me, and together we'll defeat the Pink Menace! I can start you off as a buck private, but with hard work, perhaps you can rise through the ranks and become a regular private! Patrick, you fool! This was over before it started! I will now consider your unconditional surren-... ...-der. So that's how he wants it to go down. Score one for the boys back home! Aha! Aiding the enemy! I've caught you red-handed, Squidward! Then that means he's on my side! I'm ready! Okay, Patrick, it's out. We signed a peace treaty, Squidward. You were right, fighting is for children. Squidward, that wasn't the peace treaty. That was a copy of the peace treaty. Can I be Mr. Krabs? He's a good leader. Argh! It's true, Mr. Squidward! Now get back to work! If you're in this war, then where's your fort? Forts win wars, Squidward. He's right, Squidward. That thing would never protect you. It's downright puny. See, it is too small. Exposed. Squidward returned fire! Yes, Patrick? Hmm... looks like it's time for Plan B. Did you hear something, Patrick? They taste even better. Hi, Mr. Krabs. Hey, Patrick, look at this thing. Pretty cool, huh? Wow! Look at this neat-o soda drinking hat. Oh! It must've belonged to someone who was number 1. There's only been a handful of number ones in the history of forever. Really? Ee-hee, ooh...! Oh, thank you, Mr. Krabs. Thank you for bringing us together! How can I ever repay you? All I have is 5. I'll be right back. Mr. Krabs, I found 68 cents. But maybe you can take the other $4.32 out of my paycheck! What do you say? Thanks, Mr. Krabs. Ah! My bubble production has increased two-fold, thanks to you, Hatty. Hey, Mr. K. How's the antique biz treating you? Am I a pretty girl? But, Mr. Krabs, you said it yourself... I was born to wear this hat. I don't want to give it back. I can't get rid of this hat now. Not after all that we've been through. Thanks, Mr. Krabs, I'll call you Hatty. And that's when you showed up. I'm not? Yep. Nope. Uh-uh. Nope. What is it? Seems a little dangerous. Ooh... No deal, Mr. Krabs. I'm sticking with Hatty. Thanks for the offer, though. Oh, my gosh! A floating shopping list!  How do you know my name?! Who are you?! Cursed? What guy? Smitty what? He must've been number one. Immediately? To its owner? Right now? Hey, Mr. Krabs. I was just returning the cursed soda-drink hat to its original owner: Smitty Werben Jaegerman Jensen. Sure there is. He's buried out in Floater's Cemetery. It was his hat, Mr. Krabs. He was number 1! Remember, licking doorknobs is illegal on other planets. You'll never guess what I found in my sock last night! Go ahead, guess! It was his hat, Mr. Krabs. He was number on- Let's give Mr. Krabs a big hand. I'm down here, sir. Squidward said I could help by burying myself! Me? In the Krusty Krab commercial? Me! It's almost on, Gary. Yeah, I got butterflies, too. This is the most exciting thing to happen in the history of history. Look, Gary! It's on! There I am, Gary! There I am! Look, Gary, there I am again. Look! That was the best 60 seconds of my life! Well, time for bed. Time to go do my favorite thing at my favorite place. Top of the morning, oldster. You did? You're right! Wow, he recognized me. "Weren't you that guy on TV?" Yes! I am that guy. How kind of you to notice. Weren't you that guy on the television last night? Yes, that was me. I... Oh, please excuse me, sir. Wow. I'm getting recognized all over. Why, next thing you'll know, people are going to start doing things like holding doors open for... Why, sir, I'm flattered. You're on your way. Why, of course, good sir. And next time, feel free to approach me. It most be so degrading to ask across the room. And who am I making this bad boy out to? F-I-N. There we are, darling. Hmph. Looks like shyness got the best of him. No problem, Squidward. I got one already made out. Enjoy. Yes, I am that guy on TV. Please, good people, no photos at work. Well, maybe just one. Another one? Okay. Limbo. And now, the, uh, oh, I got it. Yes, pilot. I'm so misunderstood. Alas, good people, even the brightest of stars grow weary, and I am no exception. But I will shine again after a quick break in my quarters. Stay beautiful. Solo record! They are, Mr. Krabs, and so is mine. And now I gotta lay something on ya, Krabs Baby. Nah, I can't take that gig, Krabber. That phase in my career is over. I'm an entertainer now. Come on, Krabs. Let's think outside the box for a second. Commercials are old-hat. The people want music. If I could change fate I would, Krabsy. And I'm an entertainer deep down. A people's person. We're on the same page here, aren't we? I knew you'd understand. Well, thanks for the start. I'm out of here. Pipe down, Squidward. This crowd looks angry. They're not going to wait any longer. I think I better give them what they need, and fast. No can do, Squidward. These people demand entertainment. How you doing, folks? That's no problem, ladies and germs. 'Cause SpongeBob is here to satisfy. I'd like to call this little number "Striped Sweater." ♪The best time to wear a striped sweater is all the time. One with a collar, turtleneck, that's the kind 'Cause when you're wearing...♪ ♪That one... special... sweater...♪ Squidward, this crowd is insatiable. Juggling! Thanks, Squiddy. They want juggling and jokes at the same time? Tough crowd. Uhh, what do you call a vampire whose car breaks down three miles from a blood bank? A cab! Uh, okay. There's a nun, an astronaut, and a hairdryer. Well, the most I can juggle is three, but the show must go on. Whoa! No! My career is over. All those years clawing my way up. All the people I've stepped on, wasted. They seem to like it when I put this patty on the grill. I may be able to save this act, yet. Roll with it, SpongeBob. Roll with it. There's more where that came from, folks. You like that? It seems to be working. But how do I follow it up? Buns! It's a stretch, but we've all got to push the envelope, sometime. Okay, folks. How do you like this? I'm breaking new ground. Time to get edgy. Ready for the grand finale? I'll say. I'm so glad I gave up fry cooking for this. One, two, three. One, two, three. "The Krusty Krab Employee Manual; 2nd Revised Edition; Page 35; Section 19; Clause 3a, states: All staff must remain on the premises until the day's receipts are fully accounted for". "Clause 3b: The provider reserves the right to be unfair". No. Whew. Squidward, you're making a big mistake! But a visit to the Krusty Krab makes everyone happy. And what could be better than serving up smiles? I never knew you felt so strongly about it. Well, I guess I can't stop you. But Squidward, it's a cold, cold world out there. No one's going to serve you happiness on a silver platter. Cookies! Anyways, I just want you to know, if you ever get in trouble, come find me. I'll take care of you. 'Cause you and me... ...we're like brothers, only closer. Or a football playing king in space...with a mustache. Squidward? Squidward, is that you? It's me, SpongeBob. We used to work together. There ya go. So, where you living these days? Great. And what have you been doing with yourself? No, wait, let me guess...Hmmm...I see you've been working on that mustache, the tattered clothes, the awful smell...you're a football player? A spaceman? A football playing king in space-- Even your paintings? There, there. You can come live with me. Here you go, Squidward. You can sleep in my bed. Nonsense. You stay as long as you need to. Good night, my little angel. Breakfast is ready! You're gonna need to build up your strength again so I laid out a big buffet for you. Ahh! Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Here comes the plane. It's no trouble. Is there anything else I can do for you, winner? Oh, wow. Nurturing a broken spirit sure is a lot of work. I'm bushed. Still, it feels nice to do good. Good night, Gary. Good night. Here you go. Good night. Gary! Squidward is not a freeloader and he would never take advantage of me. He's just having a hard time getting his confidence back. I'm sure he's close to a breakthrough. I know he still isn't looking for work! Don't rub it in! Coming, Squidward. Here you go, Your Majesty. Why not? What about it? Fine, I'll just take it out. Hmm, that's two things in this house that won't work. Two things that won't work! Okay. Don't move. Here you go. It's alphabet soup. I made it special. Oh, okay. How about this? Ya know, when you swatted that newspaper out of my hands, it reminded me of something a friend of mine did... At his job! ...mooching off my friends and they can get back to their lives! I've got a better idea! Why don't I call someone whose job it is to fix it? You know why? Because when I want a job done I get someone with a job to do that JOB! You want your dime back?! Take it! Now Squidward can come back, right? Then have some more dimes! I've got plenty of 'em! Listen, you crustaceous cheapskate! Squidward's been living at my house driving me crazy! And you're not gonna hire him back all because of a stupid dime?! What's that? This is a dime? So, if Squidward never stole the dime, he can come back to work, right? Ah, yes. How foolish of me. Allow me to remedy said situation right now. I will just use this changing tent here to change into my bathing suit. And I won't do anything else. Oh, I'll be changing, alright, but not into a bathing suit. Wait until Sandy sees that I brought my karate gear! Hi-yah! Hi-yah! Sandy won't beat me this time, because I've got the elements on my side. The elements of surprise. Hi-yah! Yes, Sandy, I most certainly am ready! Ready to get it on. Hi... Great minds think alike, I suppose. I may be down, but I'm not out! Hi-yah! Sandy? Oh, I get it. She's "Sandy." That's her name; she's also covered in... yes! Ew. Yeah, let's go in. Wow. How tough am I? You got a new bottle of ketchup? It's on! If I could just run this under some hot water... Too tough for me? That's downright ridiculous. I'll have you know I stubbed my toe last week while watering my spice garden, and I only cried for twenty minutes. Weenie Hut Jr's? Are you saying I belong in Weenie Hut Jr's? Super Weenie Hut Jr's? What weenies. Oh, brother. What? But I'm not a weenie! That's impossible! I demand entrance into your club on the grounds that I am not a weenie! So, your name's Reg? Mark my words, Reg. I will get into the Salty Spitoon! I will! Hey, everybody, what's goin' on? I'd like to gain entrance to your social club, please. I believe my hairdo is in order. So, uh, where do you stand on the whole bald vs. shaved debate? Hey, what about me? I was in that scrap. Well, then, I guess it's time to take it up a notch. I am not a weenie! My friends don't hang out at Weenie Hut Jr's. Patrick, what're you doing here? I don't have time for this! I've got to go pick a fight with a muscular stranger! It's the only way of getting into the Salty Spitoon! I've got no choice. Well, I guess I've got nothing to lose. Let's do it! Afternoon, Reg. Well, that makes me pretty mad. Yeah. I might have to beat someone up just to get rid of all this blind fury. Yeah, I feel pretty sorry for the next guy who looks at me funny. I, uh... don't be silly. He's not botherin' anybody. I mean, not like... that guy! Yeah, you. Standing there all smiling and whatnot. Somebody oughta teach you some manners! I don't care if you're the demon seed of Davy Jones! You're goin' down, Tubby! Wait, Patrick, you're supposed to let me win, remember? I did? Really? I can go in? Oh, my gosh, I never thought this moment would come! I, SpongeBob SquarePants, am tough enough to get into the Salty Spitoon! This is the happiest day of my life! Sandy? What happened? I slipped on an ice cube and got covered in boo-boos. Weenie Hut General? What can I do? What's that? Do other restaurants do that? "How To Become a Fancy Waiter in Less Than 20 Minutes." Don't worry, Squidward, I'll memorize every page, right down to the punctuation marks! I can't do it. I can't do it, Squidward! Every sentence, every paragraph... Spoons! Bread! Salad! Pepper! Don't you understand?! My brain is full to bursting! If I have to memorize a single order, I think I'm gonna explode! Empty my mind? Empty my mind... Table for Hommina? I can seat you immediately! It was easy, once I cleared my mind. Taken care of. Right this way, please. Good evening, sir. From our menu tonight, might I recommend the Krabby Newburg? We take the finest cuts of aged, imported kelp, stuff them with herbs from our garden, wrap them in parchment with our award-winning shallot tapenade, slow-roast them for six hours in our wood-fired, clay-filled oven, or kiva, and serve them with a garnish of wilted coral on a mahogany plank. Thank you, sir. If you need anything else, just call. Fine dining and breathing are all I know how to do. My name? Uhh... Beef Wellington? Uhh... err... the fork on the left? My name? More soup for your armpit? Please enjoy the food! Would you like some cheese on that, sir? Ugh, I got such a headache. What's going on with you? Hurry, Gary, the scary robot movie's on. What do you mean I shouldn't watch this? Scary movies don't always freak me out. What if Mom is a robot? What if Uncle Sherm is a robot? What if Gary is a robot? Gary? Psst, Gary? Gare-Bear? Gary, if you were a robot, you'd tell me, right? Oh, I've got nothing to worry about. And now to get a good night's sleep. Robot! Oh my gosh! Huh? I surrender! Oh. Squidward, why are you wearing my hat on your nose? #17 -- Krabby Patty and a medium beverage. Course. Sorry Squidward, I'm not really feeling myself today. I guess I'm a little bit jumpy. I keep thinking robots are taking over the world, probably on account of this movie I watched last night where robots take over the world. I even asked Gary if he was a robot! Pretty funny, huh? There you go! Enjoy your... Say, you're not a robot, are you? Well, keep your eyes peeled. They're everywhere. Back to work! That sounds like Mr. Krabs. That was strange. Mr. Krabs was talking to his radio, and he said he feels "recharged." If I didn't know better, I'd say he was... ...a robot! Nah. Oh my gosh. Why was Mr. Krabs making all those beeping sounds? Could it be that he's... ...a robot? Nah. Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! Mr. Krabs... talking to radio... beeping sounds... strange dancing... robot! I'm serious, Squidward! Mr. Krabs is a robot. And I can prove it, too. Let's see, in the movie the robots didn't have a sense of humor! They couldn't laugh. Hey, Mr. Krabs! Squidward just told me a hilarious joke and I thought you might like to hear it. Okay, here it goes! Uhh, how'd it go Squidward? Not even a chuckle! See, Squidward? He didn't laugh because he couldn't laugh because he's... ...a robot! Hey, Mr. Krabs! Squidward's father never hugged him. Isn't that sad? Just like the robot in the movie. He couldn't cry either. That's the final test, Squidward; the love test. Robots can't love. Hey, Mr. Krabs! I just wanted to tell you that Squidward loves you! Squidward? Mr. Krabs! Mr... Well, they had piercing red eyes, metal pinchers for hands, and they ran on batteries. Hello, Operator? Get me the Navy! Squidward, the robots are running the Navy! I don't know! Hey, a nickel! Sorry. Well, in the movie the hero teams up with a buddy, and they get the poop on the robot. Yeah, you know, they get the straight poop, ask questions, get information. I can't take it! Oh, Squidward, seeing you slap Mr. Krabs like that is just too horrible to watch! Oh, yeah. Right. Oh, yeah. What color is my underwear? Where's Mr. Krabs? This is one stubborn robot. I got an idea. Keep an eye on him, Squidward. Don't fall for any of his robot tricks. If Robot Krabs won't tell us where Mr. Krabs is, maybe one of his little robot friends will. Yeah, but I saw Mr. Krabs talking with his radio before. He called it his "little buddy." I guess it didn't know anything. This is the last robot, Squidward. I also said they couldn't love. Uh, at least he's not laughing. The movie? Oh, yeah! The ending was great! Turns out there weren't any robots after all. It was just their... imagination. Hey, it's time to feed Gary. Gary, the paper's here! You can have this, buddy. 'Cause all I need is the entertainment section! I am a happy sponge! Oh, hey, Patrick. Well, I'd better get going. I didn't say anything, either. Alright, quit messing with me, I know you said something. It's a baby scallop. No, Patrick! It's totally helpless. It looks like he can't even fly yet. No, Patrick, he's just a baby. He's all alone with no one to take care of him. You're right. Come on, let's take him into the pineapple. Hmmm, let's see, we need a box for him to sleep in. There you go. It's the best seat in the house. Is it true? Are you hungry? I've got just the thing. How would you like a Krabby Patty? Of course not. I don't know what I was thinking. What he needs is a tiny Krabby Patty. Huh? No one's ever turned down one of these before. French fries? All we have left is this apple. Of course, scallops love worms. Well, you should be good for the rest of the... I don't know! Aww, don't cry. Uhh...uhh...uhh... Blah-blah-blah, look at the funny face! Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, look at the funny face! Look at the funny face! How did you know? Wow, I'm sure glad you're here. You know, Patrick, since this scallop doesn't have parents, we should raise it ourselves. I don't think you can be the mom, Patrick, because you never wear a shirt. Yeah. Shh! Yes, Patrick? Me neither. Good night, Patrick. Patrick, breakfast is ready. Yes, Patrick? Can you take care of him? My hands are kind of full. Going? Where are you going? You mean I have to do all this baby stuff myself? Okay. Oh, great, you're home. Now you can help me with the baby. Huh? Patrick, what about my break? Uhh, okay, tomorrow. Oh, Patrick, I'm so glad you're home after working all day. I can't wait for my break. Patrick, I really need my... Patrick? Uhhh? Patrick Star, we need to talk. Don't 'one more minute' me, Mr. Man! You haven't been helping at all with Junior! We made a commitment and you're not doing your share! You never do anything. Yeah, once. Hmmm? Hmmm? Hmmm? Hmmm? Hmmm!? So, what's the plan for the day? Great, so I'll see you at six o'clock. Six o'clock. Six o'clock. Six o'clock. Oh, nothing. Do you remember what you said to me this morning? No. Does... "You can take the night off, pal!" ...ring a bell? What?! Where do you think you're going? Work?! So, this is work? Oh, you poor, poor thing. By the way, you forgot your briefcase! Overtime?! Oh, boy, yeah, you're working! And that's the kind of work you're doing? Show me where I can sign up for this, because I've been working my fingers to the bone! ​You never help! Never! Oh, that's not a stupid noise. That's just Junior about to jump out of that two-story window. Did you catch him? Junior? Hey, he's flying. Goodbye. Well, Patrick, he doesn't need us anymore. Despite all we've been through, it was worth it. Hey, Squidward, check this out. Two ordinary Krabby Patties, but when expertly tossed with the skill of a champ, they become... Heave-ho! But we were performing a ritual to attract customers. And the only way the ritual can work is for us to get hurt. Real bad. Patrick? Mr. Krabs sure has a lot of expensive treasures to drip paint on. Do you think we should take this stuff off the walls? Patrick, we're not getting paid at all. Okay, we'll just paint around all this stuff. First, we need to set up the tarp. We're gonna need more coverage, Patrick. Now that's what I'm talking about. Well, I guess we should open these cans of permanent paint now. And if we get it on anything, Mr. Krabs will cut our butts off. Patrick, the lid's already off. I'm thinking I should do this one, too, Patrick! Okay, Patrick, let's get our brushes ready. Uhh, maybe we should start with a smaller brush. All right, Patrick, gotta get started painting this wall. With the permanent paint that we're not allowed to get on anything but the wall. Well, here we go. Just a few more seconds of mental preparation and I'll be painting this wall. I'm getting to the painting. No problem. Here I go. Yeah! Huh?! Barnacles! What could be worse than a giant paint bubble?! Noooooo! Patrick? I don't think this bubble can get much bigger! Pat, no! We did it! We painted the whole house and without getting a drop of paint on anything but the-- Flappin' Flotsam! What's that?! We're dead, Patrick! Do you know what that is? That's not just a dollar. It's Mr. Krabs' first dollar! His most prized possession! And we got paint on it! Okay, this isn't a problem. Maybe I can just wipe it off. There! I think I got it. This is not good, Patrick! This is not good! Mr. Krabs is gonna be home soon, and when he sees what we did to his first dollar… But Mr. Krabs said… Did it work? Did it work? Did it work? Nothing's working! It didn't work. Hurry, Patrick, take out your wallet. Our butts are saved, Patrick! Now all we have to...Patrick, no! No…why'd you put it in the... Grab it, Pat, grab it! Hurry, hurry! Aww, Pat, no, no! Get it, Pat, get it, get it, get it! Oh, no-ho-oh! Okay, okay, we still have time! Don't panic, SpongeBob, panic is the enemy. You are strong. Through your strength, you shall overcome! Hurry, Patrick, put Mr. Krabs' dollar back on the wall! I got an idea! We're all done, sir. Everything looks great. Yeah, looks great, Mr. Krabs. We'll just be going... Oh, Mr. Krabs, we're so sorry! Don't de-butt me! Don't de-butt me! It's not our fault, Mr Krabs! Hi, Mr. Krabs. Oh, you know, just hanging around. No, No, Mr Krabs! No! Don't look, it's a trick! We're sorry, Mr. Krabs! You mean our butts? Oh, I get it, Mr. Krabs. You told us the paint was permanent so me and Patrick would be more careful and not get paint on anything! Can I make a Krabby Patty now? Does this mean I get to make a Krabby Patty now? POOP? Ah, POOP! Krabby Patty! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! Mr. Krabs, can I have a raise? Can I make a Krabby Patty now- I'd sure like to go to this party, but I can't read the invitation! Whoever sent this obviously has no idea about the physical limitations of life underwater! Well, might as well throw these in the fire. Boom! 19 seconds! That's a new record, Lou! But it's not an official record until we record it in the Book of Records. 19 seconds. Sign here please. Initial here, and here, and here, and here. Oh look, it's a picture I took of you the first time I ever came here! Look at you, so young and happy! Where do the years go? Hey, what's that? "Plan Your Own Party Kit"? Hey Lou, how much? Let's see Gary, according to the "Plan Your Own Party Kit," invitations are the first order of business. "A guest list consisting only your closest acquaintances will set an intimate tone for the evening and provide soiree success." Well, you heard the man, Gary, only our closest friends. Boy, Gary, this "Plan Your Own Party Kit" is a real life-saver. How else would I have known to make freshly-whipped clotted cream. Gary, you better call an astronomer, because this clotted cream is outta' this world! My piñata! Ooh, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot. The "Plan Your Own Party Kit" suggests creativity when stuffing your piñata, so I'm using deviled eggs. Good question Gary, but not to worry. The "Plan Your Own Party Kit" warns that unsupervised parties can lead to disaster. That's why I've taken the liberty of devising a schedule! 8:00-8:05: Guests arrive. 8:05-8:15: Opening remarks and general discussion. 8:15-8:27: Craft corner, followed by name tag distribution. At 8:27, we begin the qualifying rounds for our cracker-eating slash tongue-twister contest. 9:07: running charades. 9:38: charity apple-bob. 9:57: Electric jitterbug dance marathon, ladies' choice. At 10:09, things start cooking as I dig into my world-famous knock-knock joke vault! And as long as we stick to this schedule, our party is a guaranteed success. This is gonna be the coolest party ever! Okay, Gary, get ready. It's almost 8:00! Here they come! Don't worry too much, Gary, it's only ten seconds past 8:00. Now it's 20 seconds past 8:00! Maybe no one got their invitations. 30 seconds past 8:00! Oh, I'm doomed! No one's coming. I'm the worst host ever! Oh, the first guest, and only forty seconds late. Welcome, Patrick! May I compliment you on being fashionably late? Can I get you a glass of punch? Did you have any trouble finding the place? Here you are! So, the punch okay? Hmmm, nice weather we're having. Yep, it's mild season. Ahem. So, you read any... Oh, more party guests! Welcome, Mr. Krabs! Please let Gary take your coat, then allow me to offer you some hors d'oeuvres and a glass of punch. Two down, 175 to go. Oh, I almost forgot... These name tags eliminate the need for awkward introductions. Oh, more guests! What's going on here? The laughter isn't scheduled until 9:03! You want to throw a party, do it at your house, Patrick. Squidward, you made it! Oh, uh, sorry to hear about that. I have you making mild conversation with Mr. Krabs from 10:41 to 10:47. But if you've got a case of the jabberjaws, I can hook you up with Scooter. Here are some topic cards to break the ice. Oh, someone's at the door! Well, it's about time. Okay, everyone, the last guest is about to arrive... 22 minutes late! Attention, everyone. Attention please! Now that we're all here, I officially declare the party switch to be in the 'on' position! As soon as I get back from the coat room, we'll have a rundown of tonight's schedule. Try not to have too much fun without me! Seriously. Hey, Gare, got another coat for you. The party's going great, by the way. They're gonna be talking about this one for a long, long time. Well, back to work. Okay, everyone. Let's...huh? What's going on here? This is all wrong! What's happening to my party? No, no, no, no, no! Didn't you read the schedule? 10:00pm: Dance your pants off! 10:00pm! Let's try to stick to the schedule, shall we? Cake will be eaten at 8:52, everyone! 8:52! Hey, what's this? Could I have everyone's attention please? Patrick! If everyone could take a seat on the couch please, while I sort this out. Thank you, thanks. Hey everybody, thanks for your patience. I know we've gotten off to a rocky start here, so I'm going to get us back on track. It is now 8:37, and we all know what that means! Time to read aloud from the newspaper comics! Okay, I think I'll start out with 'The Wisenheimers.' Okay, panel one: we see Roxy Wisenheimer with some sort of rake. Wait, I can't read from this! This is yesterday's paper. I'll just go grab today's paper. SpongeBob, you sure know how to throw a party. What would they do without you? Locked out? Gee, I wonder why they don't hear me? Oh no! They're not using the topic cards! They're ad-libbing! Now they're mad at Patrick! He's hogging the deviled eggs! Look at those poor souls, they're so bored, they've gone mad! Oh, no. The party's falling into chaos without my hosting talents to guide it. Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob! Yes... no, Patrick! I'm SpongeBob! I'm outside! What? I-. No! Patrick! Wait! Phone in punch bowl? That's not even on the schedule! Oh, no, sounds like someone's rummaging through my medicine cabinet. I hope they don't touch my special comb. I hope this doesn't interfere with finger puppet theater at 9:20! If I don't get back inside soon and restore order, there might not be enough time for the scheduled events! I don't even know how that happened. Well, I have no choice. I'm gonna have to tunnel back in! Okay, everybody, don't panic, the host has returned. I can take losing the topic cards and the phone in the punch bowl, but... ...I was supposed to lead the bunny hop! This is a bunch of barnacles! I'm breaking in! I'm no criminal! I live here! I'm...I'm throwing a party. I got locked out, I swear! Boy, for a second there, I thought I was going to be arrested for breaking into my own house. What an ironic twist that would have been. But, I didn't know. Plan Your Own Party Kit didn't mention the police. Is it too late to offer you some punch? All night in the stony lonesome in a bunny outfit! Oh, yeah, the door's locked. Good thing I keep a spare key...under the mat. Grr! Oh, look at this place! This party was a complete disaster. It was? I am? SquarePants, you've done it again. I guess I know how to throw a party after all. Gary! Well it looks like you had a good time. Good night, Gary. Hi, mailman! Okay, see you tomorrow! Let's see... Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, hey! A magazine! That's funny, I don't remember subscribing to Fancy Living Digest. Look at all these glossy depictions of a higher standard of living! This guy's so rich, he has a swimming pool in his swimming pool! Hey, Squidward, how do the people in that magazine get all that money? What kind of things? That's it, Patrick! We gotta becomes entrepreneurs! Quick, Patrick, without thinking, if you could have anything in the world right now, what would it be? No, something real, an item, something you would pay for. That's a great idea, Pat! We'll become traveling chocolate bar salesmen! Fancy living, here we come! Okay, Patrick, this is it! The first step on our road to living fancy! Just follow my lead. Good afternoon, sir, could we interest you in some chocolate? Okay, the first guy didn't count. This is our real first step! Good morning, sir! Would you like to buy some chocolate? Yes, sir, we are chocolate bar salesmen! Wow... what is it? Let's try next door! Huh? Say, weren't you the same guy who sold us these candy bar bags? We're selling chocolate bars. Would you like to buy one? One chocolate bar, coming up! I... got it! One chocolate bar for the nice— —lady. We're not doing so well, Patrick. We need a new approach, a new tactic. No, let's save that for when we're selling real estate. There must be something. What was the reason we bought those bags? That's it! He made us feel special! No, wait, Patrick! Why don't we try being nice? Remember, Patrick, flatter the customer. Make him feel good. I think you laid it on a teensy bit thick there, old pal. Let me try. Um, H-H-How you doin'? Wanna buy some chocolate? We haven't sold one chocolate bar. I got a feeling that were too easily distracted. Let's make a pact right now that we will stay focused on selling at the next house. Let's shake on it. Remember, Patrick, focus. Good afternoon, sir, we're selling chocolate bars. I can't understand what were doing wrong. There's something to this selling game that were just not getting. Other people do it, I mean look at that! They are most certainly not delicious! Yet they sell millions of bags a day! That's it, Patrick! We've gotta stretch the truth! We'll work as a team. Let me get this customer warmed up, and then you come in for the kill! Hello, young lady. We're selling chocolate. Is your mother home? Oh, but this chocolate's not for eating. It's for... If we keep exaggerating the truth, we'll be fancy living in no time! It'll make your hair grow. They'll make you sound smart. They'll make you fly! They'll bring world peace! You'll rule the world! Yeah, this guy will feel so sorry for us, he'll have to buy all of our chocolate! Hello, sir. Would you like to buy a chocolate bar? We need an operation. Um, we've got some head trauma and internal bleeding. Quick, Patrick, let's help him! Careful, put him down gently. Poor, poor man. If there's anything, anything we can do to help you? Don't get me wrong, Patrick. It's great that we helped that guy out, but there's no one left in town to sell chocolate bars to. Let's admit it, Patrick. We're failures. Let's change our names to Why and Bother. No! Don't hurt us. Please don't hurt me. No no. Please... Thank you for your patronage. Not yet, pally! First, we got to spend all the money. So, how long have you two ladies known each other? Psst. Hey, Mermaid Man, get a Krabby Patty. I respect you, Barnacle Man! Evil? Holy oil spill! It's Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's arch enemies: Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble! Are you okay, Mermaid Man? Oh, how are you going to beat those three guys all by yourself? You can't give up. What if we help you? Okay! I do! Wow! The Mermalair! Wow! The I.J.L.S.A. were the most heroic heroes ever! And you had the best lunch box, too. Want to see me run to that mountain and back? Want to see me do it again? Holy halibut! It's the chief! Flopping flounder, Mermaid Man, Make-Out Reef! Make that two! Ah! Ah! Ah! Get it off! Get it off! Get it Off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Whew...I'm glad that's over! Time for Boating School! Let er rip, Gary. Ahh... Ta-da! Not bad, partner in crime. The toast could have been a little darker, though. See you later. Sorry, Patrick, I can't. I have school today. I don't know. What do you normally do while I'm gone? Wait a second, Patrick. Why don't you come to school with me? You and me in school together as classmates! Think about it! Brace yourself, Patrick. I'm about to introduce you to the greatest academic thrill ride of your lifetime. Behold, Patrick, the Hallway Of Learning. And this is the Fountain Of Learning. And these are the Lockers Of Learning. No, they're just the stairs. These are the Stairs Of Learning. I don't know. Home, probably. Class doesn't start 'till 9:00. Late for being early. And now, for the room with the most class: the Classroom. And this is the chalkboard. It's the ladle that helps us drink from the Fountain Of Knowledge. And those drinks are recorded here on the Good Noodle board. Attendance. Penmanship. Basic Desk Sanitation. Advanced Desk Sanitation. I'll add your name so you can start collecting good noodle stars, too. There you are. Oh, now, Patrick. I'm just like everyone else, no matter how many stars I have. Ahem! 74. I doubt it. That's Roger, our class science project. The greatest lesson of all: the precious value of life. You see, Patrick, Roger's shell represents the fragile line between life and death when behind the wheel of a boat. This light bulb represents knowledge. And without its energy and warmth, within minutes, Roger would die. Patrick! The best part about being early is you get to sit close to the teacher. Think you can handle the second chair? This is gonna be great! You, Patrick, she's the teacher. I guess it's just in the timing. Hey, Patrick. I thought of something funnier than 24. 25. Yes, Mrs. Puff. Big Fat Meanie? Patrick, you can't do that! She's the teacher! No... I'm a good noodle! I'm a good noodle! No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! What, me? But why? Thanks a lot, Patrick. Well, I guess I can be a Good Noodle from back here. It's so hard to hear. What kind of student sits back here anyway? 'Skool is 4 Chumps'? Where am I? Just ignore him, SpongeBob. Whatever you do, don't look at him. What? HI?! There is nothing funny about what you did in there, Patrick! You got me in trouble! You got me moved to the back of the room! You cost me one of my Good Noodle Stars! Gee, Patrick, it seems like you would care a lot about stupid stars, considering you are one! It is after class! They're talking about us! We're fighting! Detention!? In one day, I've gone from Good Noodle to Bad Egg. It's all Stupid Patrick's fault. I hate you, Patrick. I'd hate you no matter what. I'd hate you even if that made sense. I'd hate you, even if, uhh... Um, I'd hate you... even if the light bulb keeping Roger alive went out. Huh? Mmmm... I'm sorry I called you a stupid star! I'm sorry your apology is so long! I'll keep him warm and you get a light bulb from the supply closet. Oh, where's Patrick? Aw, forget it. I've got to go find Roger some warmth. The light bulb! Without its warmth, Roger will die! We did it, Patrick! We saved Roger's life! Psst, try the coral bits. What's wrong with Mr. Krabs? Congratulations, Mr. Krabs. Wow, a trip! Hey Squidward, you want me to cast out over here so you can watch me? Okay. Here she comes...She made it! I've never seen Mr. Krabs so broken up. Aye aye, captain! Yeah, and I've gotta get home to feed Gary. Oh, I get ya. Actually, it's Coral Blue number- three. Woo! Is it another fishing trip? What do you mean? Squidward, he's lost something near and dear to him. Haven't you— You're right. How do we get out of here? Okay. Oh, poor Mr. Krabs. Gone forever out of our lives... Why couldn't it have been me?! Why did he have to go like this?! Why? Wow, how did you get it back? What did you give him? Good morning, pineapple! Good morning, Gary! Good morning, world! I'm ready! World? Squidward's last name is Tentacles? Fancy. So that's what came in the mail. Looks like Gary has a new little playmate. Training? Well, I guess I can't enter Gary in that. Sunday's laundry day! Boy, you got that right. Gary's no... hey! What makes you so sure Gary couldn't win that race? You know what? I'm starting to get the idea that Squidward thinks his snail is better than mine. Patrick, are you thinking what I'm thinking? Are you thinking what I'm thinking? No, no, no! I'm thinking about entering you in that race and beating Squidward's snail! Looks like we're going to start our training now, ladies! I call you a lady to humiliate and demean you. It's a motivational tool we coaches use. Kelp powder for muscle mass. Raw eggs, 'cause they're cliché. And nails for toughness. Of course, I expect you to eat this. It's scientifically designed to help you win tomorrow. Gary? Wow, pretty good time. Patrick, your snail is a rock. Boy, the competition's getting tough. That's it, Gary. We are going to start some serious training right now. Alright Gary, let's start with some sprints. On your mark. Get set. Go! Go Gary, go! Come on, go, Gary! It's all yours, Gary! Gary? Come on Gary, the big race is tomorrow. You got to start training if you want to win. Sorry Patrick, Gary and I have got some serious work to do. Alright Gary, no more fooling around. Time to get serious. Come on, Gary, move it! Up, up, up, up! Down, down, down, down! Faster, faster, faster! Go, go, go! Come on, push it, Gary, push it! Move that shell! Come on, Gary, move it! Let's go, let's go, let's go! Faster! Let's go, let's go! Speed it up, speed it up, speed it up! Move it, Gary! Move it, move it, move it, move it... Stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke. Come on, Gary, we're gonna be late for the big race! Save it for the Loser Circle, Squidward. Gary happens to be in the best shape for the rest of his life. No, Patrick, that's the official. Alright, Gary, listen up, the competition is going to be fierce. You're the undersnail. Everybody's already counting you out. Now get out there and win, so we can rub Squidward's big fat nose in it. What! What are you doing, Gary?! The race has started! You let Snellie take the lead! Let's go, Gary. Start moving! You're blowing everything we trained for! Blowing it! Gary, are you listening to me?! Get the anchors out of your pants right now! Don't give me that look! I said now, mister! Get going, Gary! Go, go, go, go, go! Not good enough, Gary, not good enough! Faster! Come on, Gary, it's a race! A race! Have you heard of 'em?! Faster, Gary, faster, faster, faster, faster! Huh? Uhh, Gary? Umm, Gary, you can stop now! You can take a break now if you want to, Gary. No! Hold on, Gary, I'm coming! Oh, Gary, I'm sorry! Why didn't you just say I was pushing it too hard?! You did? Oh, Gary, why didn't you tell me I wasn't listening?! You did? Oh, Gary! Oh, Gary! Gary? Oh! Looks like you and I are in-laws, eh, Squidward? Hey, Patrick! You all ready for the big night out tonight? Are you ready to go crazy? Are you ready to— Let's continue this conversation in private, Patrick. I think some people are eavesdropping! Whoo! I've been lookin’ forward to this night all week! What do you think we should do first? Of course. Did you wanna come with us, Mr. Krabs? You passed the test, Mr. Krabs! I just wanna warn you, Mr. Krabs. We're always fashionably late. Hey there, Mr. Krabs! Are you ready to party? Oh, I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party, Mr. Krabs? I'm ready to par-tay! Are you ready to par-tay, Patrick? Only the most powerful chick magnet in town. The Underwater Heartbreaker. Calm your waters, Mr. Krabs. I modified this little baby myself. Only the cool kids. We're not lost, I've got my compass. Goodbye, pals! Here we are: The Wash. Just follow our lead, Mr. Krabs. And, above all, keep it cool. Hello, gang! SpongeBob's back! You guys want another rinse cycle? I'm buyin’. Oh, I know what you mean, Mr. Krabs. This is only stop numero uno on our night of debauchery! So, are you feeling that wild and crazy feeling, Mr. Krabs? Don't worry, you will. Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs? Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs? Are you feeling it? Patrick, that's not a ride. Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs? Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs? Art thou feeling it now, Mr. Krabs? Can you feel it now, Mr. Krabs? How about now? Can you feel it, Mr. Krabs? Lame?! We score here all the time. Oh, yeah, Mr. Krabs! Why didn't you ask? Sorry, Mr. Krabs. Good night, Mr. Krabs. Closing time. The saddest time of the day! Huh? It's a Krabby Patty. Eww... It's cold and hard. This could have rolled under there years ago. There, there, little one, your journey is almost over. But, Mr. Krabs, I found that under the grill. But it's old and cold. And so very full of mold. Order up, Squidward. Sorry, Squidward. Mr. Krabs' orders. Because it growled at me. Yes, Mr. Krabs? Squidward, you shouldn't be going through Mr. Krabs' belongings. He won't like it! Mr. Krabs, I knew it! You're alive! Squidward, look, it's Mr. Krabs! Isn't this too good to be true? Oh, he's taking one of those break things in your office, I mean, the 'employee lounge'. Yes sir. Krusty Krab policy clearly states that once the burger has reached the customer, it is his/her responsibility... Aye, aye, sir. Squidward, I'm worried about Mr. Krabs. Umm, you checked out of the hospital this morning. Wait just a burger-flipping second! That would be me: SpongeBob Back-SassPants. I say you got the wrong crab. This Mr. Krabs is the most generous, big-hearted, non-skinflinted crab in the whole sea. I'd bet my soul he wouldn't. Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy merchandise were the closest thing to everything. I love jellyfishing, you should love jellyfishing. You should come some time and bring your own net! Say no more, Mr. Krabs. You did it for the Krusty Krab. I would have done the same thing. No. So, as I was saying, you and me gotta hang out more. What nights are good for you? Here are the nights that are good for me: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. I gotta work. I work at the Krusty Krab. My best friend is Patrick. He's pink. I'm listening to you, mountain! Don't eat the yellow sand, Patrick. Hey, Sandy, watch me do the "Grouchy Squidward". Everybody's an idiot except for me. Huh? Don't worry, guys, everything is under control, ‘cause I'm an... Expert...! Huh, that's funny. Someone turned the mountain upside down! Like this? My what has a what now? You heard the doctor, SpongeBob. One more injury like that, then it's the Iron Butt. I've been too careless back there. From now on, I am on around the clock butt patrol. Hep, hep, hep! Stay away from the backside! I'm warning you! Whew. That was close. No. My butt is not safe out here! No part of me is safe! Hello, friends. Enjoying the outside world? Oh, living out the remainder of my life, in safety. If you guys were smart, you would join me. That accident made me realize that it's dangerous out there. I was one of the lucky ones. I'm a survivor. And so I simply decided that I'm never leaving my house again. No, Patrick's right, Sandy. You saw what happened and next time it won't just be my butt, it'll be my armpit or my forehead. I was wrong to go against nature. I'm a sponge. What was I thinking? Walking… My people are sedentary. I won't be lonesome. I've got all the friends I need right here. This is Penny... and Chip... and say hello to Used Napkin. No problem! A really long spatula. I'm a sponge! I'll just filter-feed. Listen, I've told you, but I'm never leaving my house again. Never ever ever! Never ever never never ever ever never!! Never ever... Alright, Patrick, that is enough! Chip, will you mind showing these two to the door? Look at those fools. Risking their lives, jellyfishing. My new hobby is much more safer, isn't it, Chip? Dust collecting. I think I caught one! I don't need the wish, Penny. Everything I could ever want is right here. In fact, let's sing our own song about the joy of staying indoors. ♪I know of a place where you never get harmed. A magical place with magical charms. Indoors! Indoors! Indoors!♪ Take it away, Penny! Okay, guys, really. This is your saddest attempt yet. Even Chip knows that's Patrick in the same costume that he wore for Halloween last year. 'Huh?! Oh, my gosh! This can't be happening! This is exactly the kind of thing I was talking about! Well, they were asking for it. It's not like I didn't warn them about the dangers of outside. Yes, Chip, I know they're my two dearest friends in the world, but I told them, I wasn't going outside no matter what. We can do without the name calling, thank you very much, Used Napkin! I know, Chip. If I was out there, bagged by an ape, Patrick and Sandy would risk anything to save me. And I've got to do the same for them. If I don't come back alive, Chip, take good care of Gary. Well, here we go. From the safety of my home, to the outside world. I'm taking my first step. So far, so good. I think I can do this! Oh, dear Neptune, get off of me, get off of me! Chip! Help me, help me! I'm still alive! I did it! I made it outside! Nothing can stop me now! Is it too late to go back inside again? Ah, I don't know how you do it, Gare Bear, but that's the best cup of French toast I've ever had. Well, time to punch that clock. But not before checking my motivational Quote-a-Day calendar. You are a winner. And today's the first day of summer! Happy first day of summer, Squidward! Care to join me for solstice caroling? Walking in the grass, it's so fine, don't need shoes in the summertime! Yeah. Gee, Mr. K., you sure have a scorching case of summer fever! What is it about summertime that makes us so happy? The firefly-lit nights, the intoxicating aroma of a charcoal briquette, the hypnotic sound of a lawnmower running over a flip-flop? The money? Oh. Tell me more about summer break. I've been taught the true meaning of summer. Almost closing time, Mr. K. Hey, maybe they're all at that new playground over there. See anything, Mr. Krabs? The way you drove the boat while lying on the ground was kind of cool. You got it, Mr. Krabs... hey! Another day, another dollar. Gee, I wonder what Mr. Krabs has been up to since I saw him last and then went home to do nothing of particular interest 'til this very moment. Huh? Krabby Land, sir? Where is Krabby, Mr. Krabs? Stall 'em? How do I do that? Hey, kids! No, I'm not. I'm, uh... I'm Krabby's beloved sidekick, the Krabby Patty..Umm... Burglar! Krabby will be here soon. He, uh, had to take the bus. But in the meantime, let's have some fun! You kids like bubbles? Well, you've never seen my bubbles. Voila! A bubble shaped like a jellyfish. How 'bout that? Okay, prepare to be blown back on your tailfins. Ta-da! Uh... huh. Okay, uh... and now for a finale! Oops. My eyes! Whoa! They seem to respond to me being in pain. They enjoy other people's misery. Hey, kids, check this out. I got 'em right where I want 'em.  Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ugh. Mr. Krabs? I can't take any more of this stalling stuff. The kids are using them as... boomerangs. What are we gonna do? Really? He's here? Oh, boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Listen, everybody. Krabby the Clown is in the building! Who do you want? When do you want him? I'll say you have. How could you, Mr. Krabs? You promised these children Krabby the Clown, but all I saw out there was... Cheapy the Cheapskate! But what about the true meaning of summer? What about the children? I suppose I'll never know the true meaning of summer. I thought I knew it once, but that was a long, long time ago. Yeah. Wow, thousands of dollars fluttering in the breeze. I guess that's the true meaning of summer. Where's Mr. Krabs? He's missing out on all the summer fun. Patrick, I'm scared! We are camping. Aww, it doesn't matter where you are as long as you're outdoors. While all those soft city folk are safe in their beds reading books, we're out here, pitting ourselves against the formidable forces of nature. You wanna join us? Okay. Have fun inside. Just... have fun inside! See you tomorrow. What? What? But all I... Okay. Have fun inside! Squidward's gonna come camping with us! That was great, Squidward, but how do you get inside? Customization! He's tenderizing the ground! Write that down, write that down! Nope, we've got something even better! Marshmallows. Mmm... just like the astronauts eat. SpongeBob to Patrick. I read you. Over. SpongeBob to Patrick. Me too. SpongeBob to Patrick. Help yourself. Over. But Squidward, didn't you take a can opener when you hiked out here? But this is the wilderness! It just doesn't seem to fit the camping spirit. Well, after a long day of camping, it's nice to unwind with a nice, relaxing campfire song. I call this one "The Campfire Song Song". ♪Let's gather 'round the campfire, and sing our campfire song. Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song. And if you don't think that we can sing it faster, then you're wrong. But it'll help if you just sing along...♪ ♪And if you don't think that we can sing it faster, then you're wrong! But it'll help if you just sing along...♪ ♪C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song!♪ Patrick! Squidward! Good! ♪It'll help... it'll help... if you just sing along!♪ ♪Oh yeah!♪ Ahh, now, wasn't that relaxing? Oh no! I'll save you, Squidward! Squidward, are you all right? That's it, chew, chew, and swallow. There, better? But I had to! It's too dangerous to play the clarinet badly out here in the wilderness! It might attract... a sea bear. What are you saying? Oh no, Squidward, sea bears are all too real. It says so in the Bikini Bottom Inquirer. Patrick's right, Squidward. Sea bears are no laughing matter. Why, once I met this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy's cousin... Okay, that's easy. First off, don't play the clarinet. Never wave your flashlight back and forth really fast. Don't stomp around. They take that as a challenge. Don't ever eat cheese. Cubed. Sliced is fine. Never wear a sombrero... Or clown shoes. And never... Ever... No. No. Don't worry, Patrick. I'll draw us an anti-sea-bear circle in the dirt. Maybe it's because you're not wearing your sombrero in a goofy fashion. No. Like that. Squidward, are you okay? Quick! Jump inside our anti-sea-bear circle before he comes back! Don't run! Sea bears hate that! They hate limping more than running! I should have warned you about crawling. I don't know! I guess he just doesn't like you. Here, draw a circle. That was an oval. It has to be a circle! Yeah, I'm glad it was just a sea bear. This circle would never hold back a sea rhinoceros! Heh. Good thing we're all wearing our anti-sea-rhinoceros undergarments, heh heh. Right, Squidward? I lost something once. I lost something I couldn't live without-- my identity. It all started last week-- Monday morning to be exact-- the day I lost my identity. Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it. Awk! Gary, help! I can't see. Gary! Gary, are you there? Ow! Gary? Gary, buddy? I need you to be my eyes, okay? Am I near the bathroom? Gary? Gary? Gare? Gary. Now that my horrific incident of terror is over, how about some breakfast? The most important meal of the day, serving it up Gary's way-- pop! Enjoy, buddy. Hmm, you know, I've been feeding this to Gary for years, and I don't even know what it tastes like. Bleah! Bleah! Bleah! That was the worst thing I've ever tasted. Oh well, at least I'll never have to do it again. Barnacles! All these shenanigans made me late for work. Uh oh. All right! Hi Patrick! La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Ah, ah, ah, patience, good people. A great story can't be rushed. However, I will skip ahead to the Krusty Krab. Order up! One Krabby Patty grilled with the fiery warmth of my beating heart. Enjoy. Is there a problem? While it is against my philosophy to disagree with the customer, I must point out that I am in fact wearing a name tag, right here. Huh? Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! It's the most terrible thing that's ever happened to me. I lost my name tag. Pourquoi! But I don't want a new one, Squidward. My name tag is out there somewhere. Lost... Hungry... Who will help it? What if someone's using it? I'm innocent, I tell ya! Squidward, what happened? Huh? Retrace my steps? Squidward, you're a genius. Cover me till I get back, okay? Let's see, if I'm going to retrace my steps, I got to remember everything I did this morning. Oh, hi Patrick. You said hi to me this morning, right? Well, I need you to do it again. Patrick, what are you talking about? Patrick, this is an emergency! I lost my name tag this morning, and I need to retrace my steps. Okay, Patrick, you know the plan, right? Perfect. Hmm, I guess I should start with when I woke up. I sure hope this works. Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it! So far, so good. I don't see my name tag up here. Now that my horrific moment of terror is over, how about some breakfast? The most important meal of the day, serving it up Gary's way. Bleah! Okay, next I just have to walk outside and say hi to Patrick. Patrick! You were supposed to say hi to me! Oh. All right, let's take it from the top. Don't forget your line this time! Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it. The most important meal of the day. La-la-la... Gary's way. Bleah. Patrick, why didn't you say hi to me?! Forget the motivation! Just say hi! Oh, what's the use? I'll never find my name tag in time for inspection. Hmm, let's see. I skipped merrily to the Krusty Krab, said hello to Old Man Jenkins, placed an apple on Mr. Krabs' desk... and that's about it. Oh, and these two guys threw me in the dumpster. Good one, guys! Patrick, you're a genius. Oh wait, he's probably thrown it away by now. Eh, what is that stench? Hey, it's not so bad once you get used to it. Come on in, buddy. The garbage is fine. You look over there and I'll look over here. Patrick? Patrick? Patrick! Patrick! Thank you. Have you forgotten what we're looking for knee-deep in yesterday's Top 40 songs?! I'll give you a hint. Two words. First word: my. Second word: name tag. Patrick, I would love to sit here and play Twenty Questions with you, but I've only got one minute till inspection. One minute?! Hurry, Patrick, we don't have much time. Not now, Patrick. Where?! Where?! Patrick, I don't have time for this! Where?! Patrick, are you with me or against me? Yeah, yeah, yeah... the boy who cried name tag. If you're not going to help me, then just go crawl back under your rock! My shirt backward... What the...? My shirt's on backwards! I had my identity all along. Oh, and just in time. Thanks, Patrick. I think you'll find everything shipshape. Uh... discovery? And that's how I got my identity back. Well, that's my story. Thanks, uh... Betty. Fry cook SpongeBob reporting, sir! Ooh, how weird! A machine made to look like a customer. With pleasure, sir! Hey, guys. Did I miss anything? Huh? Ooh! Phew! I salute you, oh majestic jellyfish. Your command of the sky is unmatched. Floating just out of the reach of my net, but near enough that I can see your untamed beauty. ♪If only I could join you there in the air. Floating free without a care. I wish I could fly. And see things with a different eye.♪ ♪I would fly so very high and touch the sky.♪ ♪And never have to ask why it is that I can't fly♪ Wait a minute, I'm forgetting the words of Grandpa SquarePants. I'm gonna follow his advice, by gum. I'll invent a flying machine! That, Patrick, is a flying machine. What's so funny? Well, here I go, Patrick! I'm off to fly with the jellyfish! Ignition, check! Landing gear... check! Complimentary peanuts... check-a-roo. Ready for takeoff! Don't remind me. Well, it took me all night, but here they are. The new blueprints! I wasn't even close with that last one. Propellers, rudders... This one's gonna fly! I can feel it. Ready, Patrick? It's working, Patrick! I'm flying! I'm... falling! Ooh! This is it, Patrick. The physics are all here. This time, I'm gonna fly! No, Patrick. This is the SquarePants Flyer Mark Three. All you do is remove the brick, or ballast, and... Huh? Well, back to the drawing board. Patrick, get ready to say "Eureka!" Go! It's working! I'm flying! Do not be afraid, earthbound people. I am not a flying monster, I am just one of you. D'oh! Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick! Excuse me, sir, but I would like to return this kite. "Local nutcase tries to fly"?! I'm a nutcase because I follow my dreams? Well, they laughed at the guy who invented light bulbs, too! You'll see. Go on and laugh, but it is a sad day in Bikini Bottom when a guy is ridiculed for having dreams! Huh? Ooh! Well, it can't get any worse. D'oh! I guess I spoke too soon. There they go again, Gary. I suppose I'll never join them in the sky. I'll be stuck on the ground, sentenced to a flightless life. Oh well. I guess all dreams aren't meant to come true. Back to reality. No, Gary, my dreams are silly. Hello? No, this isn't the Bird Man of Bikini Bottom. What? No, I certainly do not live in a birdcage. Who is this? Joe Momma? Well, listen up, Joe. I hate to break it to you, but flying is impossible. I have to go now. My head just hit the ceiling. Huh? Hey! Look, Gary! I... I think I'm flying! Jellyfish Fields, here I come! ♪I'm flying. I'm flying!♪ ♪They laughed, they scoffed, before I had liftoff.♪ ♪I'd love to hang around to say I told you so.♪ ♪But it's off to Jellyfish Fields I go!♪ ♪Roads and streets are not for me.♪ Gotcha!

That's enough good deeds for one day. I've got a date with a flock of jellyfish. But, Mr. Krabs, I invented these pants so I could fly with the jellyfish! If I keep doing favors for people I'll never make my dreams a reality. Let's roll! Where to, Mr. K? You've got it! What's the emergency, Mr. Krabs? I think my pants can handle it. Yes? Clean up crime? That's your emergency? All right, Mr. Krabs. I'll clean your garage. But after this, no more favors! All done, Mr. Krabs. Aw, shrimp. Finally! Jellyfish Fields, here I come! Patrick's in trouble. What is it, buddy? Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm supposed to be at Jellyfish Fields right now. But instead, I'm rubbing your scalp. And I don't even know who you are. Dennis? If I don't give these feverish favor-seekers the slip, I'll never get to fly with the jellyfish.  I'm almost at Jellyfish Fields. I'm gonna make it! Well, it was fun while it lasted. I guess I'm not meant to fly after all. Huh? Hey! My jellyfish friends are helping me fly! Without pants! I guess it just goes to show... ♪You don't need a plane to fly♪ ♪Plastic wings may make you cry♪ ♪Kites are made for windy days. Lawn chair with balloons... fly away♪ ♪Inflatable pants... you may as well skip!♪ ♪If you want to fly, all you need... is friendship. Yeah.♪ Goodbye, jellies! You taught me a valuable lesson. Although I'm not quite sure what it was. No more flying for me, Patrick. I'll leave that to the jellyfish. Did Patrick just...? Nah! Wait for it... Ahh, isn't it great working at the Krusty Krab, Squidward? Huh? Isn't it? Working here? Yeah. Aww, yeah. Hold that thought, Squidward. I'm doing the parking lot for early morning litter patrol. May Neptune shine brightly on my harvest. Litter. Looks like someone missed the trash basket, huh, Mr. Candy Wrapper? Kids these days. I've never seen such an epidemic! Well, at least it's all over now. Where is all this litter coming from?! Not on my watch. Sir, I will have you know it's against the law to litter. Yes. Well, let's just say I hope our litterbug there saved room for his just desserts. Yeah, just desserts. Who? Who? He seems kind of angry with us, eh, Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Hi, officers. So, he's going to jail, right? Yeah, Strangler. Hey, that looks like me! You nice officers will protect me, right? Those officers are right. I need a bodyguard! Mr. Krabs! There's a maniac after me! I need a bodyguard! This would be him, Mr. Krabs. Ugh, that's it. I gotta get out of town 'til I can find a bodyguard. You don't understand, mister. I need protection from the scariest guy in town. Here's his picture. I tattled on him, and now he wants to strangle me with his diabolical hands! I hope they're not dirty. Hmm, looks good to me. You're hired! I feel safer already. What's next? Or that pebble. Or that stick. Or that receipt for the Phony Baloney Mustache Emporium. Oh, bodyguard, my body is in your guarding hands. What do we do first? We could go to my house and turn off all the lights! Yes, excellent. Ah, but first, I gotta do a few errands. Quick is my middle name. Let's see...paper towels. This one says 'best paper towel around' this one says 'best paper towel in town'. Hmm... in town... around... in town... around... what do you think, bodyguard? I'll take both! Hmmm. I'm not sure if these are my pants. How about this one, bodyguard? Too overbearing? Here we are. SquarePants Manor. Bodyguard, let me just take this opportunity to say you're the best bodyguard a fella could hope to have. Protect me? Don't mention it, Strangler. I mean, bodyguard. Now where'd I put my key? Well, I can't find 'em. You wanna take a look? Sure. With these spiky cleats, anything is possible. Ya. I'm trying, but my cleats are stuck in your corneas! Don't be mad, bodyguard. Let me just grab the key I keep under the mat and we can get inside. There you are, you little rascal. Now, to put the key in the lock, which should activate the tumblers, thus opening the door. Step inside... Well, here we are. I know, isn't it great? Ooh. A surprise party to celebrate my perfect on-time percentage at work? Oh, how'd you guys know? Bye, everybody, thanks for coming! Bye Mr. Krabs, bye Plankton, bye Sandy, bye Larry, bye Pearl, bye Mrs. Puff, bye Squidward, bye, eh, the rest. Ahh, alone at last. Just you, me, and the floorboards. Yeah. How did you guys know today is my birthday? Thanks for coming! Alone again. Uh-huh. Oh yeah. Wait! We can trust Patrick. He's my best friend. So, Patrick's the Strangler. Gee, you think you know a guy. He's not? Hey, how'd you do that without shaving cream? Wait, bodyguard, I need protection! I'm not safe! Come back! Good idea, bodyguard. He'll never find us up here. Good thinking, bodyguard. The Strangler could have been on that plane. Bodyguard, bodyguard! The Strangler! Well, Patrick, here it is, the Palace of Pranks, the greatest novelty shop in Bikini Bottom. All the greatest pranksters shop here. This is where I got my gag seanut brittle can. Patrick, wait, it's a booby trap, remember? That gets funnier every time you say it, Patrick. Come on, let's go inside. Ah! Nothing compares to the smell of cheap plastic novelty items. Pranks, gags, and gross-out toys as far as the eye can see! Isn't it everything I said it would be, Patrick? Great, Frank. This is my friend Patrick. He wants to become a prankster, too. You see, Patrick, Frank here is the master. I learned all I know about pranks from him.Okay, Frank, let's see what you've got. What can we get for one dollar? What else have you got? Nah. No. Eww! Don't you have anything good? Wow, invisible spray! Gee, Patrick, just think of the pranks we could pull with this. Thanks, Frank. Here it is, Patrick. The ultimate prank-- invisible spray. I know! We'll go spray the park bench and then sit on it, and when people walk by, we'll be floating in midair. Well, let's get started. Any particular reason you took your pants off? That it does, Patrick, that it does. Good thinking. Here, hold this a second. Okay, Patrick, give me the can. Patrick, spraying the park bench was my idea. Give me that thing. Oh my gosh, Patrick, help me find our clothes! Righty, where are you? No one messes with Righty! We'll see how you like it! Kind of gives you an empty feeling, huh? No guts, no glory! Oh, no, it can't be! How are we going to pull off the ultimate prank? Thanks a lot, Patrick. You used the last of it. Oh, forget the pants, Patrick. Let's get home and wash this paint off. Oh sure, it's...half past invisible. Let's ask this guy. Excuse me, sir, but do you have the time? Thank you. Wait a second, Patrick, my brain just hatched an idea. Okay, we're invisible, right? If that guy thought we were ghosts, we could haunt everybody in Bikini Bottom. Oh, it's the ultimate prank. Let's go scare us some suckers! Boy, we really scared her! A better question would be, "Who isn't?" It's official-- we're the greatest pranksters ever. The whole town thinks we're ghosts. There's only one guy left to scare, and we'll have pranked everybody in Bikini Bottom-- Mr. Krabs. We'll see about that! Krabs, we've come to haunt you. You can't escape, Krabs. We've glued the door shut. Too late, Krabs, we've already clogged all the toilets. Wait, Patrick, I've got one more idea. You're going to pay, Krabs. Pay! Pay! I know not these names of which you speak. We're really sorry, Mr. Krabs. Please don't chop us into little pieces and eat 'em. Yeah, the invisible paint stains clothes. Yeah, I think I'd die of embarrassment if that happened. Mr. Krabs, thanks for being such a good sport. That Mr. Krabs, always looking out for me. What a guy. Patrick! We should have bought the whoopee cushion! New business hours: 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. Squidward's right. That's totally unfair! Couldn't we get to work earlier than 6:00 a.m.? Like 5:30 a.m.? Or 5:00 a.m.? Or 4:00 a.m.? Or-- Did you hear that, Squidward? We get to keep working and working and working without ever having to go home! I've got to pinch myself, because I must be dreaming. Well, I'm not dreaming. Krabby Patty, I don't care if we have to stay open until the day after the end of time. As long as I am with you, I am complete. ♪K-R-A-B-B-Y P-A-T-T-Y, says I.♪ Team Krusty Krab! Did you hear that, spatula? You, me and 10,000 Krabby Patties. And the best part? No breaks! Wow! ♪K-R-A-B-B-Y P-A-T-T-Y...♪ 1,322... 6,654... 7,121... 8,659... Oh, hey, Mr. Krabs. When did you get here? I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. Could you run that by me again? That's what I thought you said. Now, let me offer this as a rebuttal: Stay back! I'm warning you! No, don't eat me! I'm too chewy! Holy shrimp! They're everywhere!  No, no! I want to live! I want to live Mr. Krabs, what's going on? Everywhere I look, I see killer Krabby Patties. Spatular. Grill. What does this mean? Wrestler? Oh, but where am I going to find a psychiatrist? Ow! Hey, look at this! "Dr. Peter Lankton: Psychiatrist. Specializing in Krabby Patty phobias". Gosh, I don't know about this, Mr. Krabs. Wouldn't I have to miss work if I went to see... Well, this looks like the place. Hello? Doctor? You're a bit smaller than I imagined, doctor, but I guess that's why they call you shrink . Do you think there's hope for me, doctor? Oh, good. Jumping jacks? I see giant Krabby Patties! Hatred! They're coming for me. No! No! No! Stay back! I'm ready! Work. Spatula. Bun. Oh, okay, I've got it. Potahto. Tomahto. Um, you're making me nervous. I'm finished! I've arranged them into a piano. Fiber? Hypnosis?! Where am I? Gee, thanks! The king of flavored dairy drinks! Oh, Krabby Patty, I'm so glad we're friends again. In my heart? It worked! I'm cured! Oh, you're right! I'd better get back to work! Thanks for everything, doc! Yeah, I just needed some sleep, is all. Oh, Mr. Krabs...! Easy... Perfection! Just a second, Squidward. Well, Krabby Patty, it's time for you to go now. You grew up so fast, I... Oh, I promised myself I wouldn't do this. Just take it Squidward, take it away. That's me! Mmm. My compliments to the chef! Hello, what's this? Mr. Krabs? What's a hidey-hole? What's in this thing? Treasure? Why'd you dig up your navy chest, sir? Wow, look at all your cool navy stuff! What's that? Neat. How'd you win that? Wow! Oh-oh. Who are those guys? Did you have a cool nickname, Mr. Krabs? You were? Well, I guess you were thinner back then. You want me to punch you in the stomach? wow, my entire arm disintegrated. Aye, aye, sir! Alright, let's get this place ship shape. You men, stop laying around! To battle stations. All hands on deck! Set course for full flavor. Ketchup and mustard off the port bow. One Krabby Patty ready to set sail. Mr. Krabs. Hello? Mr. Krabs? You alright? Are you sleepy? Mr. Krabs! I don't smell his pulse. What's that? Is somebody there? You're alive! And naked... What's molted? Wow. Barnacles! Sorry about the foul language, Mr. Krabs, but you're acting like there never was a man in that shell. The Krabs of his navy days was fearless. He wouldn't let something as insignificant as a missing shell slow him down. Who cares how silly, pink & fleshy you look. How non-threatening, limp & soft you are. How... ...oops. Wow, it sure is dark in here. Look, Mr. Krabs, I'm you! Well, I'm glad you got my point. It's not what's about on the outside. It's what's on the in... I get to be a navy buddy? Oh, that'll be a snap. Squidward and I have been doing it behind your back for years. Look at me, I'm Mr Krabs. I love money. I once won a marathon because someone dropped a penny at the finish line. Every night, I tuck me wallet in and tell it a bedtime story. Goodnight, wallety. Oh, what's that you say? Me daughter, Pearl, needs an operation? I'll do it me self and save a nickel. Well, here goes...wow. I've never seen so many manly naval men. So tough, so brave, so...clever. And I'm one of them! I won't let you down, sir. Coming! Okay, boys, let the SS Party drop anchor right here. Like pineapple? I live in one. Well, if you think you're man enough. Fire the torpedoes. Thanks for the trophy, everybody. I...uhh... Let me spin you a manly yarn. So there I was, in Jellyfish Fields. Me supply of bubble soap was dangerously low. And as I blew my last bubble... Why, jellyfishing, of course. Oh, well, I gotta go. Uhh, thanks. Oh, I thought you'd see through my ruse. I mean, arr, you don't think I was just gonna collect this here trophy of manly toughness without reminding you silly livers why you give it to me in the first place. Let's have it. No holding back. Give it your all. Well, uhh, I-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i, I guess I'll take my manly toughness trophy and head home now. See you around manville, boys, uhh, men. None taken, Mr. Krabs. Look at that, Mr. Krabs. Your navy buddies all had something to hide. This isn't happening. This isn't happening! The horror, it's unspeakable! Don't you see, Squidward? It's closed! The Krusty Krab is closed! The doors are locked. The doors are locked and we are on the outside. Outsiders. What are we going to do, Squidward? There are Krabby Patties inside all alone. Mr. Krabs, you're here! Gosh, Mr. Krabs, we were worried something might have happened to you. That the world would've been deprived of the greatest food known to man. I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. Are you hurt, Mr. Krabs? Oh good, I thought you were hurt. Poor Mr. Krabs. What are we going to do, Squidward? I'm serious, Squidward. We should get Mr. Krabs a new mattress and surprise him with it as a gift. Then we'll never have to be late to work again. That's okay, Squidward, you'll warm up to the idea. Thanks for coming with me, Patrick. I've never seen so many mattress. How many do you think there are? Cool. Making a card for Mr. Krabs. To go with his new mattress. Oh, that's okay, as long as Mr. Krabs is happy with his new mattress . We noticed how miserable you were on your lumpy, old mattress. Mr. Krabs! Is it serious, doctor? Will Mr. Krabs be alright? We gotta get in there, Squidward. Mr. Krabs is counting on us. Terrific, Patrick, you found it! Over there, Squidward, underneath that really big guard worm. Well, that's Mr. Krabs' mattress, alright. Let's go get it. Because that would be rude, Patrick. Ah, isn't it beautiful, Patrick? You can see everything from up here. Hey, Patrick, I think I can see our houses from here. Yeah, and you woke up the guard worm, too! Worm-bait to the retriever. Worm bait to the retriever. We're in. Out. Understood. Out. Understood. Out. Affirmative. Affirmative. Out. Oh, that's why he calls himself 'The Retriever'. I dunno. Great idea, Patrick! Yes, Patrick? Nice worm. Good, kind, gentle worm. Wow, I think you're right, Patrick. Okay, see the stick, boy? Go get it, boy! We feel silly. Okay. Can you explain the plan again, Squidward? Steak sauce? Happy Halloween, Squidward! Run, Mr. Krabs! Run like you're not in a coma! Hey, Mr. Krabs. No, Mr. Krabs, it's us! Not just meat, we're choice cuts! Right, Squidward? Careful, Plankton, I just mopped there. Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I will do whatever it takes to keep the Krusty Krab formula from getting into Plankton's evil hands. No, they're usually silver. Um, Mr. Krabs? I thought you might want to hear my testimony for when you call me as a character witness. I've been rehearsing it. But I... Oh no! Mr. Krabs' lawyer! Speak to me! But what about Mr. Krabs' case? But, I'm a...a liability. Really? Everything? A suit? Wonder where I could get a suit. Here I am! SpongeBob LawyerPants, your honor. Your lawyer, umm, fell down on the job, but don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I have everything under control. It's uhh, all in here . Yep, right in here. Umm... your lawyer didn't give me the combination. Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'm on the case. Bombs away! Mm-hmm. Yes, your honor. Poor Gram-Gram! Huh? May it please the court, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. My client has been called cheap , miserly and chronically tight-fisted. But, if he were as cheap as the prosecution claims he is, would he be able to sit there quietly, while I took out a dollar and dropped it in the blender? Yes, your honor. Defense calls Squidward to the stand. Mr., uhh, Squidward, is it? My client has been called cheap. Would you agree with that ludicrous statement? Allow me to rephrase the question. Can you tell the court of some instance of Mr. Krabs' generosity in any way? So it was you who made the floor slippery, wasn't it? Answer the question! Need I remind you that you, sir are under oath? Mr. Krabs, I'm surprised at you! We can't give up just because things look bleak. This trial will be won by what's in your heart, not what's in this dumb old case. It's open! Defense calls Plankton to the stand. Why did you go into the Krusty Krab that day? Are you sure it wasn't to make off with one of these? Gotcha. Weren't you there to steal the formula of the most delicious, sweet smelling sandwich known to Bikini Bottom? Krabby Patty... That's okay, Mr. Krabs. I made you a present. Close your eyes and hold out your hand. It's a "wet floor" sign. I made it myself. Hey, Patrick. Carrying this heavy bag of snail food for Gary. He's fine. Uh, Pat, can we talk about this some other time? This snail food is really heavy. Ahoy, Captain, what have we here? It's a tiny form letter. "Dear Sir or Ma'am... We are sorry we missed you. We will attempt to re-deliver your package at our earliest convenience." Hello? My package. Whoopee! Oh, let's see what we got here. My official Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy paddleball set. Whoo! Yeah! What's this? "Take the Dirty Bubble Challenge! Hit the paddleball 29,998,559,671,349 times in a row." Dirty Bubble, wherever you float, I hereby accept your challenge. Darn it. Darn it. Darn it. Darn it. What was that? Oh, Gary, that distracting sound came from you. I'm sorry, I can't play with you right now. Mermaid Man needs me. Gary, please! I'm trying to defeat the Dirty Bubble. So, let's get this straight, Gary. You don't want me to defeat the Dirty Bubble. You know, Dirty Bubble—terror of the seven seas, arch nemesis of my favorite TV superheroes, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, and apparently renowned paddleball champion. Well, I for one, recognize the importance of this undertaking. But whether or not you do remains to be seen. Now, if you don't mind, I would like to get back to it. Pets. Sometimes, I wonder if they understand a word you're saying. Gary, I hate it when you do that! Now get! And leave your master to his important affairs. Hey, I got one! Dirty Bubble, say your prayers. Darn it. Oh, darn it. Darn it. Darn it. Darn it. Darn it. Patrick, I... I took the Dirty Bubble challenge. Why are you crying, Patrick? Really? What happened? You lost the...? That's terrible! Come on, Pat. Let's have some kelp cookies and seahorse milk—that always cheers me up when I've lost something. There you are, Pat. Fresh seahorse milk. Hey, Pat, you ever feel like you're forgetting something? Something important? Hmmm. I think it has something to do with this bowl. Gary's food bowl. That's it—I gotta feed Gary. That's a lot of dust for a couple of hours. Gary! Dinner! Come on, Gary, soup's on. Gary? Hey, Pat? How long was I taking the Dirty Bubble challenge? A week? Are you sure? Ten days? Gary! Gary? Gary! Gary? Gary! Gary! Gary! Gary! Patrick! I can't find Gary. This never fails. Gary's favorite treats. Gary can't resist these babies. They're filled with eight types of organic sediment that bottom feeders like Gary can't get enough of. Yeah, something like that. All you really have to do is shake the can. Gary comes running every time. Go on, Pat, try it. Let me see that. Hmm, I don't understand, this is a brand-new... Gary? Gary! Gary, where are you? Are you under here? Gary! Keep shaking, Patrick. Gary! You check over there. I'll check in here. Find him yet, Pat? But there's nowhere left to look. I doubt Gary could fit in there. Here goes nothing. Look, Pat! Let's see. "Dear SpongeBob, These last few years have been some of the best of my life, but I must move on. Don't bother to come looking for me. By now, I have probably found a new owner who actually remembers to fill up my food bowl every now and again. Sincerely, Gary. At least until my new owner renames me." Dear Neptune, what have I done? Gary. Gary! Gary? Gary! Gary! Gary...! Oh... Gary! Sorry, Mr. Krabs, I was out all night looking for Gary. You see, he ran away and, well, now I... Well, I'm not exactly what you'd call okay, Mr. Krabs. You see, my... Gary. Gary... This wouldn't be the first time I disappointed someone who was hungry. Well, you see... Yes, Mr. Krabs. I should've told Gary how important he was to me. You're right, Mr. Krabs. If I'm going to find Gary, I'm going to need to work harder at it. No, Patrick. We're going to use this stuff to go find Gary. Patrick, now is not the time for talking. We've got work to do. Here's a good spot. "Gary! I am sorry! Please come home! Love, SpongeBob". Quick, hand me the tape. Patrick, this is no time for that. There. Come on, Pat, just take these fliers and hand them out. Pat, no! Gary, please come back to me! Go, boy, go! I can't cry anymore, Patrick. When Gary left, he took all my tears with him. Gary loves balsa wood! I got to try to forget Gary. For some reason, I can't get him out of my mind. I blew it, I really blew it. I took you for granted, Gary. I'm sorry! Don't just stare at me, say something! I'm talking to a billboard. Now I'm hearing things. If only I could see you one more time so I could tell you how much I love you. If only I could hear you meow one last time. Yeah, like that. Gary, your purring is making it hard to forget you... GARY! Oh, Gary! So, did you hear any of that, or do I have to repeat myself? Okay, good. I promise, Gary, things are going to be different between you and I. You'll see, pal. Now let's go home and get you something to eat. You must be starving. Ooh. Skill Crane. Thanks, Mr. Krabs. Well, why don't I give it a try? It's a bear! I'm gonna call you Beary. Wow, Squidward, you flipped him over! That takes an awful amount of skill. Beary says he's getting lonely. Don't worry, Beary, I'll get you a friend. There ya go, Beary. Wow, thanks for your help, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Okay, Mrs. Wiggles, order up. Beary cooked this one all by himself. Oh, he makes me so proud. But, Mr. Krabs, today is Monday. Money, money, money, money, money! Pardon me, Squidward. SpongeBear, Jr. here wants me to win him a little brother. Two in one quarter? That's not fair. What's that, clown frown? Oh, you'd rather sit next to lovely lion? There you are, nice and cozy. See ya later, Squidward. Squid, I think you have a problem. Hey, you want me to tell you the secret of how to win on this machine? Mm-hmm. Are you ready to be a winner? Yeah? Yes? Yeah? Yes? Okay, Squidward, okay. I face the crane. Deposit my quarter. Then I close my eyes. Quiet, Squidward. I'm being the crane. See? Now you try. Squidward, do you wanna win or not? Okay, Squidward, put your quarter in. In the machine, Squidward. Close your eyes. Now be the crane. Be the crane. Be the crane. Be the crane. You're a winner! Triple decker, on deck. I sure did. Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, you're the man. Uhh, Squidward, I don't think the same principles apply. Wait, Squidward! He did it. Yay, Squidward! Yeah, that's Squidward. He's got the magic touch. Ding. Tada! Ah! Squidward, open your eyes! Hang on, buddy. I got ya. I guess I can only pick up toys. Good morning, Squidward! I came to make sure you don't oversleep and miss work. My pleasure, Squidward. That's what good neighbors are for. What's that, Squidward? Sunday? No wonder Squidward's grumpy. He forgets his Sunday papers. This'll show Squidward I'm a good neighbor. I'll bring it to him. Man this is heavy. Oh, pardon me. Monster! To inaugurate you as president. You're the president of 'The Secret Royal Order of the Good Neighbor Lodge'. It's a secret. What colors should we paint the laves, your presidentialocity? Yeah. Whenever you're ready, Patrick. Okay, Pat, gimme a quick shake. Okay! I'm ready! Hey, that worked perfectly. C'mon, good neighbor Patrick, let's paint the town polka dot. Hi, president Squidward. Almost done painting the- Yeah, our president sure knows how to live. I'd like to call this meeting of the good neighbor lodge to order. Let's begin with role call: Patrick. OK…Squidward? Squidward? Squidward, you home? Nope. I guess he's still on his Sunday drive. I hope he's not in danger. As members of the good neighbor lodge, we are sworn to protect our president from danger. Brother Star, we'd better check this guy out. Make sure he's safe for Squidward. We're checking to make sure this guy really is a certified foot masseur and not some kind of assassin. Squidward, have you ever seen more lovely French tips? Squidward, does that include… Gee, Patrick, do you think Squidward was trying to tell us something? Gee, Pat, maybe president Squidward's right. C'mon, let's go.  President Squidward? We hereby present you with this delicious cake. It's like a carnival ride. We gotta turn this thing off. Nope, not it. Nope. Hmmm, where to look. Hmmm, this off button seems suspicious. We did it, Patrick! President Squidward? Mr. President- But we just wanted to… Hey, Squidward, you got one of those, too? This'll be great. The three of us cleaning up Bikini Bottom. Well, see ya next Sunday, president Squidward. Hooray! What's happening? Mr Krabs! Mr Krabs, they're putting up pennants in the Krusty Krab. What's going on? Retiring? I sure am. Have fun, Mr. Krabs. New manager? Krabby O'Monday’s? Mr. Krabs! What are you doing here? I knew you'd come back, Mr. Krabs, I just knew you would. Aye aye, sir. Aye aye... Eugene. Where's the love? I tried to tell them... but they wouldn't listen to me! Oh, Squidward! Time for work, Squidward. Another day, another dollar. Good one, Squidward! Another day, another nickel. It's funny, because it's true! Nickel. Ok, Squidward, see ya tomorrow. Another day, another...nickel! 2 Krabby Patties. Another day, another nickel. I don't? But... I am? Yeah, a little. It's that bad? I have been laughing a lot, lately. My laugh box? Is that what happened to you, Squidward? Sure, I'd love a good laugh. I don't wanna burn out my laugh box, Squidward. How long do I have to avoid laughing? Thank you so much, Squidward! I don't know what I'd do without you! A day without laughter is a small price to pay to save my laugh box from utter destruction. I must remain vigilant. Nothing funny over there. Nothing funny over here. Patrick, banana peel, don't! Oh, no. Wait a minute, Patrick! Please stop! Wait, Patrick, I can't laugh. Get a grip on yourself, SpongeBob. You're in control. Just back away from the whoopee cushion, SpongeBob. They're everywhere. Everywhere! I gotta get outta here. There's nothing funny up here. But just to be safe... Ah, I made it 24 hours without laughing. That's odd. I've lost my laugh. I've lost my laugh! It's terrible, Patrick. I can't laugh anymore! I went a whole day without laughing and now my laugh is gone. Mr. Krabs? I lost my laugh. Not really. Nothing. Maybe I should ask Sandy. She's a scientist. The thing that used to give my life meaning and purpose, but now mocks me with its cruel indifference. Sounds painful. Thank you, Sandy. I read all the books and still nothing. I guess I'll never laugh again. Hi, Squidward. But Squidward, I...I broke my laugh box! You mean...my laugh box isn't broken and it was a cruel lie that sent me into spiral depression. I could laugh the whole time? I guess I did. It's really not that funny, Squidward. See ya later, Squidward. Hey, you laugh just like me. Ah, there he goes off to share his laugh with the world. Hurry, Patrick, it's almost time for the joust. Excuse me, my good man, I believe thou meant to say "Righteth this wayeth". How's that mutton, Patrick? Isn't this exciting, Patrick? To think, we'll be watching the joust this close up. Pat, do you know how to ride a seahorse? Mr. Seahorse, sir, you're gentle on beginners, aren't you? I don't suppose now would be a good time to ask for a bathroom break! Patrick! Look, some employees from the restaurant came to help us. Whoa, they really go that extra mile for authenticity. Salutations fellow knights. Ah! I get the point. Gee, Pat, these props sure are convincing. Squidward, what are you doing here? Good one, Squidward. "Dost thou talketh to me?" Wow, what'd you do? They sure do take their role-playing seriously around here. Knights, jesters, dragons, medieval bowling alleys, 12th century? Don't you see, Patrick? We really are in medieval times! Wait, we don't leave without Squidly. Because, umm, Squidly has thought of some brilliant songs for the king and he just has to hear them. Isn't that right, Squidly? Squidly, uhh, maybe you should wait for the king to hear that. Hey, Mr. Krabs. Sorry. Wait, you don't understand. We're not from here. No, we're time travelers. Help me out here, Patrick. Well, I guess this is it, Patrick. I'll miss you, too, buddy. We're going on a perilous journey? Lemme guess, more praise for our heroic stature? Say no more, Your Majesty. Us manly knights are so manly, we kick ourselves out of places. Come on, Patrick! I know we're a prophecy and all, but I don't think we can stop the dragon with our bare hands. At last, an honest man of the soil. Observe, as a I effortlessly commingle with this brutish native. Greetings, iron man. I am Sir SpongeBob of Bikini… ...Bottom. We just wanted to buy some armor. A little heavy, isn't it? That's perfect! It's a good thing I packed us a lunch of delicious Krabby Patties. I am SpongeBob and this is Patrick. We've been sent to rescue Princess Pearl from Planktonamor. Medieval Sandy! I know how to handle this: With a little karate! I am bad, oh yeah! Whoo! Pssh, did you hear that, Patrick? I told you she thinks like a squirrel. Good one, Medieval Sandy. But can you handle my feet of fury? I don't understand a word you just said! Uhh, Medieval Sandy, you don't look so good. Sandy? Sandy…? Patrick, it's working. Do it again. Yeah, karate! Yeah, you think we fooled them? Wait, that's Pearl. I must fulfill the prophecy while you untie Patrick and the royal doofus. Hang on, Pearl, we're coming to rescue you! We're a-comin'. Almost there. Oh, dear Neptune. Unhand her, you fiend! We're here to rescue you, Pearl. Whew! Can I get a glass of water? You truly are the nastiest wizard in all of Bikini Bottomshire. Prepare to be vanquished. What the…? Where…? Oh… I didn't see you. You're so tiny. That tickles! Tiny powers! Tiny powers! Wait a second. Wow, the boys back home will never believe this. Well, I guess this is it, Pat. Sure, buddy. Patrick, look! He's eating the Krabby Patty. No, Patrick, it's a good thing. Sure it is. Just listen to him purr. He loves that Krabby Patty. Umm, I'd be more than happy to make you some more of those delicious Krabby Patties. Oh, I guess I shouldn't have agitated that seahorse. That was some dream, huh, Patrick? Patrick? OK. Right this way, sir. Terribly sorry, sir. Will there be anything else? You look fabulous! Your gentlemen caller awaits. SpongeBob! And this devilishly handsome sponge is your waiter. You're it. Wait, Pat, you're it! The sign! Patrick! Let me help you out of there, buddy! Is the rest of you down there? Whew, you had me worried there, buddy. Here's your head. Well, let's stop laughin' and let's start fishin'! Go ahead, you get first crack. Huh? Those are some big words, Pat. I've never heard you use them before. Well, let's expand our jellyfish nets. C'mon, Patrick. Look, buddy, I captured one! Okay...what do you wanna do? Pretty. Fragile. C'mon, Patrick, let's do something fun. I was thinking more like jumping rope, 1-legged races , or playing duck-duck-hermit crab. How about some jokes? Patrick, what's the difference between a guitar and a jellyfish? Yes! What's wrong with Patrick? I sure hope he gets better soon. Are you better, Pat? Uhh, whatcha doing? Wanna visit Squidward? How do you know so much about music? Does that include... belch-talk-ing? Uhh, guys? Now that you have some free-time, let's get some grub. Well, I have a brand new bottle of super-bubbly bubble soap. Well, maybe later we can play pirates. What? What do you mean? But Patrick... you're my best friend. Yeah. Goodbye... Mr... Best friend! Sandy, you there? I need some professional help. Patrick? I never thought I'd lose my best friend. How can I compete with geniusness? Ohhhhhh! Well, at least Patrick's my friend in my memories. Coming... Patrick, you're kidnapping me? Yay! What should we do? Let's do this. Oh, yeah! Yeah. That was fun, huh Patrick? It went away when you jumped off that cliff and knocked your head clean off. That's what? Patrick, what are you doing? Patrick! Hold on, buddy! There ya go. Don't worry, Patrick. I found your head last time, I'll find it again! Not back there. Not under here. What if I can't find it? Oh, poor headless Patrick! Patrick, your head is back! But, uhh, do you feel different? I guess... we'll never have fun together again. Yes. Uhh, it was right here. But if that's your head, then what did I pick up over... Brain Coral! No wonder you got so smart, buddy. Here you go, Patrick, your old head. Are you sure you want to give up being smart and sophisticated to be my friend again? Not just an idiot, Patrick. You're also my pal. Patrick? Say something, Patrick. Patrick, you're back! Time for another glorious day at work. Good morning, Squidward! And isn't it a lovely morning? Why are you playing the clarinet on your way to work? See ya at the Krusty Krab, Squidwart. Hey, Sandy, what's this? Ooh, that sounds fancy. Whoa! Where'd it go? Uh-oh, I'm late for work. Do you think your machine can zap me over to the Krusty Krab? Whoo-hoo! Gee, Sandy, this sure feels... Hey, Squidward! Hi, Sandy! Yeah, me too. Oh, it's not so bad, Squidward. Now we can be best buddies and do everything together, forever. Together forever. Don't worry, I'll drive. Oh, hi, Mr. Krabs. Aye aye, cap'n! Squidward, everybody knows I'm a sponge. I look nothing like a balloon. Two Krabby Patties coming right up. I can't... reach the buns. Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I'm on it. Time is money. Right. Hello, bun. At last we meet. Look on the bright side, Squidward. At least we still have each other. Squidward, this is your moment. The story you will tell when you look back as a... superstar! Now go out there and give them the best darn show they've ever seen! Uhh, hi. Wow, they really liked it. Squidward, I wouldn't--! So, I was all ready to drain the fries, but I cooked the fries slightly too long! So... So, here's where the bizarre twist comes in. They weren't overcooked at all! Wow, what happened to the Krusty Krab? Why did you build a hotel, Mr. Krabs? Ooh! Yes, Squidward? Your Krabby Patty, sir. Hey, Squidward, cool rock. Why, thank you, Patrick! Room service! Here's the fifty Krabby Patties you ordered. How may I serve you, sir? Oh, yes, sir! Thanks, Squidward! Aye aye, guest sir. Your room, sir. Yes, sir! Here you are, sir. Psst, that's not really a Krabby Patty with cheese, toenails, and nose hair. Sorry, Mr. Krabs! We were all out of cheese. No good, Mr. Krabs. There's room for you to sit up front! Me, too. Honk honk! Beep beep! I'm ready to drive. Are you ready for my driving test today, Mrs. Puff? Seat-belt-aroony. One second. Start the engine? Now what do I do? Did I pass this time, Mrs. Puff? I failed? I got Mrs. Puff fired. I am? Yes, sir! I'm ready to drive Ready for my test, sir. Crawl? Left turn. Crack. Bump. Nickel. Hey a nickel! Pebble! Oh whoa! Oh whoa! Whew! Pebble! Oh whoa! Oh whoa! Whew! Pebble! Oh whoa! Oh whoa! Whew! How to drive, sir? Sir, yes, sir! That'll be easy. Um, yeah. You just put the jigamahoo on the doohicky and uhh... I might need a couple minutes. It's ready, sarge! Watch for pedestrians. Check mirrors. Observe that speed limit. Watch for pedestrians! So, umm, how'd I do? Now I know this forwards, backwards, and sideways. Am I ready to get behind the wheel? 1003, 1004, 1005. Ooh, pebble #143. Ha! You will not trip me up again, pebble #143. 1006, 1007, 1008. Old lady with a ham sandwich. 1009, 1010, 1011, 1012, 1... 13. Really? I'm ready! I'm ready. I'm... Yes, sir! Left turn at pebble #143. Kid with a ball. Nice boy. Yes, sir! Step 1: seatbelts. Step 2 would be... ignite engine. Step 3 would be... ...engage blindfold. But I can't do it without a blindfold. Aye aye, sir. There you go, sir. All I had to do was unscrew two of the bolts. Man down. Man down. Sorry, excuse me. Sorry. Sorry, Patrick, I can't stop the boat right now. I can't see! I can't see! Hey, I can't see! Did I pass? Hey, Mrs. Puff! Sorry I'm "unteachable". I got you a welcome back gift, Mrs. Puff. I found all the pieces and glued them back together. I promise it won't take me a million tries this time. Behold, Patrick! The official Goofy Goober Backscratcher! And it only cost me 52 box tops. Ooh. Mm-hmm. Oh... Oh! Whoo! Oh, yeah, that's it! Uh, Patrick, that's not the backscratcher. That's my arm. You know, we shouldn't keep this all to ourselves. We should let Squidward try it out. Onward... to Squidward's house. To Sandy's house. Hey, Sandy, you gotta see this! Sandy? What's going on here?! Sandy, are you okay? What's wrong, Sandy? Who? Oh, come on, Sandy. I'll bet you invented lots of useful things. This helmet looks impressive. What's it do? SpongeBob to Peanut. Come in, Peanut. It's saying... "It's dark in here." Got anything else, Sandy? So it's got a few bugs. Patrick and I'll help you fix it. Right, Patrick? Patrick? Everything'll be fine. We can't let Sandy leave, Patrick! They're looking for an invention, right? So let's start inventing! It's time to get serious, Patrick. That's a pencil, Patrick. It's already been invented. Light bulb, already invented. That's a mirror, Patrick. It's already been invented. Ooh... I give up. I'll never invent anything. I'm ashamed of myself, Patrick. I gave up too quickly. We'll build Sandy's bosses an invention so amazing, they'll give Sandy funding forever! We've done it, Patrick! We've created the greatest invention the world has ever seen! Patrick, they're here. Sandy's bosses. The reason we spent all afternoon inventing! Why, everyone in town has benefited from Sandy's scientific knowledge! Before Sandy showed up, I used to be a scrawny weakling! My name is SpongeBob. Professor? She should be back any moment. Patrick! Don't you think it's time to show them Sandy's invention, Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick? Well? Gentlemen, I can say without exaggeration that this is the most important invention in the history of the universe! I give you... The Automatic Backscratcher, Hair Comber, Nose Picker, and Ukulele Tuner 9000! Uh-huh. Isn't it great?! Patrick, don't you think we should test it? That's not exactly what I had in mind! Good work, Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick. Pudding? I don't remember that part of the invention. Oh, I really wish Sandy were here. Sandy! I'm sorry, Sandy. We were trying to keep you in Bikini Bottom, but all we did was ruin your chances to stay. Wow, Sandy, they're going bananas for your nutcracker! The Flying Dutchman! What are you doing in my house? Squidward! Squidward! Squidward! Help! Squidward, you have to help me! There's a gh-gh-gh, a ghost in my house! PATRICK! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, you gotta help me! The Flying Dutch... ...man. Gary! Don't you dare hurt my little Gary!  Gary! It's okay, Gary. Goodnight, Gary. Um, Dutchie? Is this gonna be much longer? Well, you've been here a while, and, uhh, I've seen all your tricks. Eeeh. Oh, no, no. I meant that I'm just used to it, that's all. You just gotta scare someone other than me. Just what kinda talk is that? You're just off your game, that's all. Sure, relax a little. Hey, champ! How's it... What is going on around here? Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no! Everyone, get out! Dutchie! Do you wanna spend eternity on this couch? Look in the mirror. You're a ghost of your former self! Yes, you are. But we're going to raise you up from your squalled conditions through the use of visual aids. Watch now. A journey into self-awareness. Now get off of that couch and into your clothes, Dutchman! It's time to get serious. Let's start you off easy. You think you can take that old lady down there? Now that's the Flying Dutchman I know. Let's see you put those words into action. Now he's got him. Wait a minute! I think you gave me the answer to all your problems! ...goblins...guilt trip... Dutchie, it worked! You got your scare back! And, maybe your ship will be repaired soon. Good Ol' Dutchie! Yes, Mr. Krabs? What's this, Mr. Krabs? I can buy stuff with just this piece of plastic? I don't need money? Wow. Detective work. I'm going undercover. Angela likes Brad. I'd like to buy that piece of plastic with this piece of plastic. Umm...I'm pretty sure it has a 'B' in it. That's it? Hmmm, I'll never understand the workings of high finance. Oh, no, I bought the wrong present. Now this is obviously the greatest present ever. Isn't he dreamy? I'm back, Mr. Krabs! The delivery truck will be here momentarily. That's it. Back it up. Right there. Let 'er go! Just watch. Hit it, boys! Here's the receipt. You're a good dad, Mr. Krabs. All right, Gary, ready for your yearly shell waxing? Just look at that shine! Now let's check under the hood. Geez, Gary, this place is a real snail-sty. Still? From New Year's Eve? What?! I've been looking everywhere for this, Gary. My favorite novelty t-shirt! Oh, someone's here. Special delivery? Just for me? You think I'm...special? What could it be today, Gary? A videotape? "You're a winner -- SpongeBob SquarePants". I'm SpongeBob SquarePants! King of Karate? Ooh... Did you hear that, Gary? I'm going to be crowned... King of Karate! Whoo-hoo! Hello, Sandy. Have you heard the news? I've been invited to Karate Island to be crowned the king of karate. Oh, sure, Sandy, all the big karate experts go there. Maybe your karate was the best, but now they've recognized a new number one. All right, Sandy, you can come with me to witness my crowning moment. Are we there yet? What make you think that's Karate Island? Hello there, the King of Karate has arrived. Oh, thank you. Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. Mr. Udon isn't interested in a karate novice like you. He only has time for royalty. You hear that, Sandy? He called me "master." Bring on your best fighters! I'll try to go easy on 'em. Pa-shaw! Watch and learn, sister. Yup. That's how the King of Karate does it. Who's next? The one and only. I'm ready to be King of Karate! My throne. Come, Sandy, take your place next to the king and share in my crowning achievement. Bring a seat for my air-breathing friend. Oh, do I detect a note of jealousy, Sandy? But who's being crowned King of Karate - not you. Sandy's going to miss out, big time. No! Sandy, I need you! I can't handle this myself. No, Sandy! You mean I'm not King of Karate? Don't do it, Sandy! Sandy, I'm sorry I acted like a jerk back there. Thanks for saving me from... buying a condo. I still have one question, though. Does this mean I'm not King of Karate anymore? Did you say a monster Krabby Patty?! Oh, dear Neptune. We can do this. At the count of 3, we flip. Ready? 1, 2, 3. Spat? Work? How can I go back to work without... without Spat?! WHAT?! There is only one spatula for me, and that is Spat. Spat, wait up! Spat! I'm coming, Spat! Oh, Spat, we've been through so much together. Thank you, Doctor. Replacement spatula? How can anything ever replace... HEY! Look at that! Ooh. Looks fancy. So shiny. All those lines so sleek. What am I talking about? I don't need this. Maybe I do need this. OW! I'm sorry. I've got some loose change in my pocket, will this cover it? How about now? Now? Now? Now? Now? Now? That's everything I have. Now can I buy Le Spatula? Evening, sir. Hey, granny, what's shaking? Ooh, breezy today. Thanks, Squidward. It was worth every penny. Soon, everyone will know of your beauty. All my shame went into here, Mr. Krabs. Oh, just the answer to our little production dilemma. Anything you want and more. Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs, no can do. No, it's not that. It's just that this is a highly developed piece of engineering that takes quality time to master. Oh, I don't think that'll be a problem, Mr. Krabs. In fact... Oh, you won't believe what Le Spatula is capable of. Ready to show ‘em, buddy? Oh, it's okay. No need to be shy. It's always tough the first day on the job. 1 Krabby Patty, coming up lickity split. Spat, is there something wrong, pal? But, but, I thought we were friends. Le Spatula, wait. I gave up everything for you. We had something. Le Spatula is gone, Mr. Krabs. I had a spatula once. A real spatula. One that stood by me through thick and thin, through grease and gristle, and I betrayed his loyalty, like a fool! You're right, Mr. Krabs. The true measure of a good spatula is by his actions. Not by some fancy chrome and buttons. I gotta find my old spatula. Spatula? It can't be true. It's too late! I know. He's moved on to the big kitchen drawer in the sky. He's gone! Oh, I'm so sorry. Spatula! Oh, buddy! Oh, I'm so glad you're better! Spatula, what's wrong? But I didn't mean to betray you. Mr Krabs needed a replacement. Krabby Patties don't flip themselves, you know. It was a moment of weakness. I'm sorry! Oh, what have I done?! What have I done?! : All that glitters is not gold. Goodbye, best friend! I'll never find another spatula like him again. Spatula? You're back! Oh, spatula, now that we're together again, nothing will ever separate us. Okay, buddy, we can do this. Ready? 1, 2, 3. D'oh! You can't rush perfection. Always the kidder, Squidward. A wishing well, here? Wow! Yeah, Squidward, don't you believe in magic? Well, I do. This well's gonna make a lot of dreams come true. What's the first thing you're gonna wish for? Squidward, aren't you excited? This is really gonna help people. ♪Take a penny and some magic, even though your life is tragic...♪ ♪...you can throw all your dreams down the well. Although everyday the pain grows you ride unicorns on rainbows, if you throw all your dreams down the well. When your life's come apart at the seams and you've given up all your dreams, here is just the means to make those dreams come true. No more suffering, no more sighin', no more pain and no more cryin'.♪ ♪When you throw all your dreams down the well.♪ Well, Squidward, what do you think? You mean magic, don't ya? And I've got a date with a Krabby Patty. A promotion? Why do I have to go down in the well? How long do I have to stay down here? Thanks for the promotion. It sure is dark and scary down here. Our very first wish! I can't wait till it comes... Gosh... Ow! Hey! Patrick! Patrick, this is a wishing well. Just throw in a coin and make a wish. Patrick. Patrick, you're supposed to let go of the coin when you throw it. Well, we've got 6½ hours ‘til the end of my shift. What do you want to do now? Tag, you're it. Tag, you're it. Tag, you're it. Tag, you're it. I did great, Mr Krabs. I got a nickel from Sandy, 2 pennies from Mrs. Puff, a penny from Plankton... ...and this slightly used pair of dentures. This wishing well was a wonderful idea, Mr. Krabs. Has anyone's wish come true, yet? Really? Can we come out now? Aww, no one's wishes are coming true. What did we do wrong? I know I believe hard enough. Maybe I just didn't dig deep enough. What do you say, Patrick? Are you ready to dig for some magic? ♪Oh, the magic has gone missin' and everyone's still wishin' but their dreams have fallen flat upon the ground. You'll find magic under rubble so, Patrick, grab a shovel and here is where the magic can be found. We're at the bottom of a well but man won't it be swell, when we make everyone's wishes all come true.♪ Holy mackerel, look, Patrick! We've struck magic. Next to being a fry cook, it's the most important thing I've ever done. Do you wanna make a wish? Guess what, Squidward? We found the magic. No, it's true! We did find the magic. Oh, I wish you could see it. Squidward! You decided to join the party. We were just gonna play some party games. Tag, you're it. Maybe if you had more upper arm strength. It means he's afraid of Santa Claus. Stop it, Patrick, you're scaring him! Umm, Squidward, you're standing on my foot. Hey, hey, hey, guys. You shouldn't fight in here. This is a magical place. Bye, Squidward. Enjoy your trip! We didn't get any money. But we found something better. We found the magic. We dug down deeper in the well and found the magic. Now all the wishes will come true! That's great, Sandy! It's beautiful, Mrs. Puff. How's about letting me take it for a spin? See, Mr. Krabs? She wished for that boat. Is that proof enough for ya? Mr. Krabs! No! What's going on Mr. Krabs? Whatever you say, cap'n. Mr. Krabs, look at this cool knickknack I got at the Chumporium. Uhh, Mr. Krabs, I really don't think there's anything weird in there. That's some good news, Mr. Krabs. Right away, sir. Hi, Squidward. Gary! No, dirty boy. This isn't like you. Gary's not misbehaved! But there does appear to be something wrong with him. Oh, of course. Affirmatory. Yup. Yupie. Yup, yup, yup. Uhh... Gary? Gary?! Gary?! Gary?! Gary? I can't believe that sweet and slimy snail would cause all this destruction. But Mr. Krabs, it's me, SpongeBob. Could a voracious flesh-eater do this? That's right. So let me in before I'm eaten. Huh? Come on, Patrick, would a zombie have a picture of his best buddy in his wallet? Gary! Are you okay, buddy? Come here, boy. All those people think you're a monster. But I know you're just a snail. Gary... How could you? No, don't hurt him. No, I won't let you touch Gary. S.D.E. and S.E.? Easy, boy. But what about Gary then? If he doesn't have a disease, why'd he bite all those people, including me? Oh, Gary, I knew you weren't disease-ridden. You still love me? Good ol' Gary's back. Squidward? You're not a zombie, remember? Why, Mr. Krabs? What could be wrong on this fine day? Time off? Aye aye, Mr. Krabs. I'm ready, vacation. I'm ready, vacation. Vacation. Vacation. Hey, Gary. That's right, Gary, I am home early. I'm on vacation. Well, good night, Gary. Good morning, Krusty Krew! Hello, Squidward. What's a vacation? No work?! But what'll I do all day? But who will fry the patties and clean the grill while I'm gone? Squidward can't do it all alone. Replacement? I really should tell Patrick the proper patty-flipping technique. I'm on vacation, Gary. I'm not allowed to go to work. My stomach has receded! Mr. Krabs said I couldn't work at the Krusty Krab. He didn't say I couldn't eat there. This is my ticket back inside! I'm not here to see you, Squidward. I'm here as a customer not as an employee. Just gonna grab a Krabby Patty with Patrick for lunch. You have my word, sir. No working. Hey, Pat, it's time for your lunch... Patrick, you can't do that! You need to turn up the grill to exactly 298 degrees Fahrenheit. Patrick, this is no way to treat a Krabby Patty. Wait, it's not what you think. But my knowledge could help Patrick maintain the high standards of the Krusty Krab. Yes, Mr. Krabs. Oh, what to do, what to do. I know just the thing to get the spirits up. The official Krusty Krab playset. Sure thing, Mr. Squidward, sir. 20 Krabby Patties coming up. Oh, what to do on this boring vacation. Hey, I know just the thing to get the ol' spirits up. Sure thing, ol' buddy, ol' Squid. 20 Krabby Patties coming... You're right, Gary. It is unhealthy to think of the Krusty Krab while I'm on vacation. I need to get out of the house. Mr. Krabs is right. In order to enjoy my vacation, I need to stay away from work. Physically and mentally. Hey, that reminds me of... Hold it right there, Mr. WorkaholicPants. You're on vacation. You just need to sit down and relax. That's more like it. Just sit back and watch the clouds. That one's a jellyfish! That's a pirate ship. And that's low salt ketchup...whoa! Low salt ketchup? Got your steaming, hot bun delivery here. Patrick, shhh. Somebody help, I'm stuck! Mr. Krabs! Thank Neptune it's you. I'm in a bit of a fix here. Um, Mr. Krabs? Noooo!! Uh oh. Thanks for the ride home, Mr. Krabs. Just take the next right. Mr. Krabs, we just passed the turn off. My house is back that way, Mr. K. Where'd you say you were taking me? It's not fair. Why would Mr. Krabs try so hard to get rid of me? I'm only on vacation. Unless, it's a... ...permanent vacation! That's it! Mr. Krabs wants to replace me. Oh, I should've known! Patrick's had his eye on my job all along! He's been scheming! They think I'm outdated! They think I'm all washed up! Well, I'll show them! Who do they think they are? I gave the best years of my life to this place and they think they can just fire like that? Like trash? I don't think so! I've been waiting for you, Patrick! Oh, I told him to stay home and watch television. Oh, Mr Krabs, I love the putrid grease of the Krusty Krab so much, I just couldn't stay away! You must've saved a fortune. Wow! That's more than I make in a year. Yippee! I happily acquiesce. I'm ready! I'm rea... Ah, what is this? Curly tresses, poofy texture, itchy scalp... it's a wig! Hi, Patrick. How do you like my new wig? Pa... trick... what are... you doing? Patrick, the only thing attacking me is you! It's okay. Why did you do that? Well, it's not, but that is an excellent idea. It's my new look. I'm wearing a wig. Thanks. I am very fashionable today. Why, thank you. Hi, Squidward! Notice anything different about me today, Squidward? Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh? ...Huh? I'm wearing a wig. Can you believe I found it lying around in the street? If you want to, after work, we can go look for a wig for you. Wig away! Order up, Squidward. Yes, Mr. Krabs? Oh, that's my new wig, Mr. Krabs. Take it off? But I can't, Mr. Krabs. My wig makes everyone so happy. Ever since I've been wearing it, everyone I see gets a big grin on their face. Oh, please let me keep it, Mr. Krabs.  I see you've noticed my new wig. Pretty impressive, huh? Glad you like it. I'll see you later, Sandy. Two krabby patties and a side order of looking good. You know it. Uh, the name's SpongeBob and no, I am not meeting royalty. You must be referring to my regal appearance. Thank you all for your kind words. I wish I could give you such nice wigs. This isn't good. Everyone's getting jealous. Squidward, I'll be hiding in the kitchen if you need me. Almost finished. See, Squidward, it's functional, too. Thank you, Squidward. I don't understand. Hello, handsome. Sss. Hmmm, I've never been tall before. That tickles. I think that it looks cool. For your information, Mr. Krabs, Squidward has locked me in the freezer, so I think I know what cool is. But, Mr. Krabs... So I can't have a wig or a butt? Hi, Sandy. What do you think? Why would I want to get rid of my wig? Look at how happy it makes everybody. I know. People just can't keep their eyes off of me. Oops. Pardon me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me. and SpongeBob trips over it. SpongeBob gets his wig stuck in some cheese on the floor. Get sunstuck but a soda is still in the wig] Hey, the wig broke my fall! Mmm, popcorn. Ah, you always come through for me. Shhh! It's very rude to talk during a movie! You, too, Sandy. People are trying to watch the movie. People, return your attention to the movie. I know my wig is glamorous and exciting but there is no need to start a riot.  I guess you're right, Sandy. I got so much enjoyment out of the wig, myself, I assumed everyone else did, too. I know. I just want you to know that even though I didn't know you existed a few days ago, I can't imagine life without you! No matter what they say, you'll always be cool to me. I'll never accessorize again. Wigs. Wigs, wigs, they're everywhere. Patrick! At least he's not wearing a wig. Everyone's wearing wigs! Everyone! I'm starting to feel a little betrayed. Hey, you made fun of me yesterday. I thought powdered wigs were uncool. Wow. Ned and the Needlefish wearing my wig. So, I was cool before anyone else? I wish I had a wig. Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Ocean wave. Tropical breeze. Reverse Whirlpool. Oh! Oh. Oh, Squidward, you've swallowed your clarinet again. I'll get it. I'll get a better look. Mm. It's too dark. This calls for extreme measures. Got it! Hey, the pointy bit at the end is missing. What's a reeeee? There's only one thing to do. We gotta see Sandy. Ooh! Can do, Sandy! Hut-hut-hut, hut-hut-hut! Hut-hut-hut, huttidy-hut-hut! Hello citizen. Guarding Sandy's submarine. Can't. I'm guarding it. You're right! Patrick, you're a genius! SpongeBob and Patrick reporting for guard duty. I don't think Sandy grew, Patrick. I think we shrunk. Where are we, Patrick? It's Sandy. Sandy, where are you? Where are we? Um... we broke it. No problemo. Nice and... easy! Give me that! Ew! Where are we? Mayday! Mayday! We're sinking! And Patrick won't stop screaming! The reserve tanks are almost empty. Patrick! Natural gas? Wow. Yay! I never thought it would end this way. It's working! SpongeBob to Sandy. We've reached the foreign obstruction. I'm already on it. This stupid hammer won't break anything. You're right Patrick. Whirlpool Spin! Reporting for Duty, Mr. Krabs. Sure, Patrick, ya... Who did? Ahh, a briefcase?! He might be a paid assassin! But, Patrick, you can't go. Not like this. Who will go with me to the next jellyfisherman's expo? Unset it, please unset it! Umm, Patrick, those are my clothes. That's my peanut butter. I can't believe you're leaving, Patrick. With all my pickles! Wait! Stop! What about all our plans? 8:00am - Wake up Patrick, 9:00am - Eat Kelpo with Patrick, 10:00am - Brush teeth with Patrick, 1:00pm - Stare at Patrick. Who's gonna do all that with me? But... what if you weren't Patrick Star? You are Patrick Star, but you won't be for long. Well, Pat, that disguise didn't work. We're gonna have to try harder. Too bad we couldn't come up with a better costume. Hmmm... That's it. With the seaweed on your head, you could be a... Patrick, there already is a Mr. Seaweed Monsterman. It's okay, Patrick. So you can't be a monster. But that vegetation on your head gives me an idea of what you can be. You're all set. Come on out, Patrick. The disguise is working, Patrick... I mean, Patricia. ...tricia. Pat-ricia. Patricia! Actually, Larry, she's not my girlfriend, she's just a... But she's not my girlfriend. C'mon, Patricia. But, Mr. Krabs, the Krusty Krab doesn't open for another two hours. Mr. Krabs, this is Patricia. No. Quite an appetite, but she's all woman. But if you reveal your secret identity, you'll have to leave Bikini Bottom! What's the matter, Patrick? The assassin. I won't let you do it. You'll have to do something horrible to me before I let you throw Patrick out of town. Get outta town! To beautiful Sunny Seashores Resort. Look, this guy wasn't trying to run you out of town, he just wanted to sell you a luxury vacation at a modest price. Hey, buddy, what do you say we go home and get started on this list? Okay. Squidward! Good evening, Squidward. Oh, we're not here to ruin it. We're here to enhance it. Isn't that right, Pat? Uh, Squidward, could you turn it down a little? Squidward, how come he's so emotional? Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? What is that thing, Patrick? Hi, stranger. I am SpongeBob. Wait a minute. Maybe he's not a monster. Maybe he's an endangered species. We should help him. Not like that. With lots of love and affection. We can take care of him. Well, Smelly, here you are. Your new home. Oh, Smelly, this is going to be great. We'll be one big happy family. Let me show you around. Here's your bed, Smelly. Here's your food bowl. You can live here forever and ever. Oh, look, Pat. He's crying tears of joy. Well, Smelly, there's one more family member you haven't met. Smelly, meet Gary. Aww, look at that, Smelly, Gary likes you. Gary, no! Gary! Yeah, Gary's never attacked anyone like that except Squidward. I guess Smelly can't live here. That's a great idea, Patrick. You’ve always wanted a pet. Isn't that cute? Look how excited he is to get to your house. Bye, Smelly. Have fun at Patrick's. Hmmm, what's all the commotion? Smelly. Excuse me. Pardon me. If I can just scootch through there. Excuse me. Pardon me. Excuse me. You leave Smelly alone. He's just a poor, dumb wild animal. Smelly. This isn't good. No one should be treated like that. Not even someone as ugly as Smelly. Something needs to be done about this. And I know exactly what that thing is. Okay, Patrick, remember the plan? No, not that. I'm talking about the plan to break Smelly out of this animal prison. All right, I'll go down first. Keep a lookout and follow me. Shh, we'll get caught. Fear no longer, dear Smelly, we are here to rescue you. Understand? We are taking you home. Look how excited he is. Flip the switch, Patrick. Smelly, you're free! Run, Patrick, run! Faster, Patrick. Don't worry, Smelly, you're safe with us. Well, we're all one big happy family again. Let's see where this dark sewer tunnel leads. Oh, it's all right, Smelly. Soon, we'll be home and you can sleep in that cozy little pet carrier you love so much. You're right, Patrick. That must be the way out. Whoa... where are we? Let's go ask those guys. Um, excuse us. Hey, they look just like you. Go, be with your real family. Go ahead, Smelly. I know you've come to think of us as a family, but it's better this way. Me too, buddy. Me too, but he's with his kind now, where he belongs, and on that note, let us go back to where we belong. Come on, stovie, pop that corn! Get ready, Gary. Incoming! Popcorn is served! I want to impress and amaze my friends! Here it is: Mister Magic's Magical Magic Kit. Look at all this! A book of spells, my very own wand of whimsy, the beard of Rasputin, and, of course, the all-important license to practice magic. Squidward! He'll appreciate my newly delivered skill. Well, let the rotting continue, friend, while I impress and amaze you with...magic! Silly Squidward. I won't learn vanishing spells until I become a level 10 wizard. No, I better start with something simpler. Say card conjuring. Here, hold this simple, playing card while I transform it into a magic playing card before your very eyes. Let's see... step 1... Which brings us to... step three. Juggle something. Well, if you insist, Mister Magic. Then take one card and shove it in your ear. And finally, say the words "Hobris-Pobris". Squidward! My simple card-trick has turned you into an ice cream cone. Which means... I am a level ten wizard! I suppose I should change you back to squid form. Presto! Uh, let's see. Umm... A-ha! Alakazam! Abracadabra. Okilee-dokilee. Hobra-cobra. Oh! Open sesame. Change-o back-o to Squidward-o, please-o? Oh, I am so sorry, Squidward. I've transformed you into a delicious dairy dessert and I can't change you back! There, there, Squidward. There is no need to cry. I promise you will continue your normal life despite the fact that you are now edible. Whoa-oh! Squidward! Speak to me! Speak! Hey, Squid, are you okay? Hey, Squid, are you still okay? Hey, Squidward, I got something for ya! Someone to keep you company in that drab ol' freezer. Oh, aren't they cute? I promise to stand by as an eternal guard over my buddy. I have turned poor Squidward into a frozen dessert. It's all my fault. Yeah. I turned him into a tasty soft-serve with a waffle cone. Patrick! Stop eating Squidward! Patrick! Pat...! Look, Patrick! Don't you understand!? This isn't just your ordinary ice cream cone. No! It's Squidward! And no matter what happens, I promised him that I would watch over him to ensure his soft, frozen life is unchanged. Patrick! Squidward has melted! Quick, call the police. What am I going to do?! Oh, Neptune, it's all my fault! What have I done?! What have I done?! It's all your fault! Curse you, Mister Magic's Magical Magic Kit! Curse you! Hey, that's it! That's the answer to our problems! No, Patrick, the one mystic being that can help us: Mister Magic! Just follow the brown-tiled road to the most mysterious mystic of them all! No one's ever seen him in person. It is I, SpongeBob of the SquarePants, Magician Level 1. And I have turned my friend into ice cream. Well, thank you, but well, I can't change him back. I need your help to change him back. But if you don't, my friend will be a cone forever. I'll wait. Oh, please. But, sir, no one else has your power of sorcery. I don't know, Patrick. Who are you, good sir? Are you Mister Magic? Does that mean you can't change my friend back? I don't need a refund, I want my friend back! This isn't about money. You're nothing but a fake--just a lying, corporate businessman, tainting the purity of magic with your corrupt commercial ways! You have ruined my faith in the magical arts. What are we going to do about Squidward? Mister Magic was a fake and all his magic stuff is fake! All those magic words, they were fake. Yacky, shmacky, bappy, dappy, doppy, blabby, flabby, murkery, fool, magic of bloob-jiggacacies!... Squidward! You're back. The magic words worked. I really am magical after all. Can I turn you into something else, now? Sure, buddy. Patrick-a mayonnaise-ica. I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! Patrick, did you bring my flashcards? No, Patrick! Patrick, I needed those. 57 times. I'm a winner? I'm a winner. I'm a winner. I'm a winner! I'm a winner! I'm a winner! I didn't get a license, Patrick. No, Patrick, I failed the boating test. I guess 58 wasn't my lucky number after all. Let's just go home, Patrick. No, Patrick! I've been training for years. They'll eat you alive. No, Patrick. No! I shouldn't have let him do it. What kind of friend am I? I'm here for you, buddy. You got a perfect score? Perfect score. Like a winner. Huh? I'm so happy for you... Whoa! Right, Patrick. I can't think of one thing that would make this day better. Except maybe getting my license. Two millionth? Yeah, just like you. Can we go home now? We've been driving around your house for hours. Thanks for the ride, Patrick. Patrick, what are you doing? 4:00? Who could be at the door at this hou— Now what is it, Patrick? You got your license. You got a new boat. Oh... I just need a few minutes sleep. Yes, Gary, I saw his new boat. I'm so tired. Thanks, Patrick, but I'd rather walk to work. Thanks for the ride. That's it. I am through driving around with Patrick. If I have to see one more boat mobile... When did we get a drive-thru? I used to have a dream. Welcome to the Krusty Krab, may I— What's with the helmet, Patrick? Uh-huh. Oh? Oh, that would be great. Patrick! Mom! Hey. Patrick, the speed limit is 40mph. 40.5mph? That's almost 41mph. He's speeding. Patrick! Stop this car. Officer, it is my civilian duty to report that the the driver of this vehicle is speeding. Why don't you clock him with your radar gun? Are you sure you don't want to run him in? It's a red light, Patrick! Patrick, you just ran three red lights! You're suppose to stop! Driving genius?! Why would a genius make an illegal u-turn... through an orphanage?! I should've gotten that license, and this should be my boat mobile! If you were my friend, you wouldn't rub your license in my face! Oh, give me that! I worked my whole life for this! You don't deserve this! Patrick, what do you think you're doing? What have I done? Patrick can't survive in prison. He's too soft. Wait! Patrick's innocent. I tore up Patrick's license and threw it out the window. I'm the litterbug. Take me instead. Patrick! I'm glad you passed the test. I'm glad you have a license. And to prove it, I made you this: Pals 4 Ever. Let's put it on your boat mobile, buddy. What? Oh, then what do we do with this? Yeah! Ready, pal. Woo! Woo! Ah, there's nothing like spending quality time with my Gare-Gare. Patrick, what are you doing? Why? Small portion meals? Patrick, don't you worry. I got your back, man. Hi there. Huh? No, I don't know any starfish. Even if I did know this "alleged" starfish, Patrick wouldn't owe any overdue library books. Wow, Patrick, that's great! That you're king! When you're a king, you can get anything you want. Your wish is my command, your majesty. Good townspeople, let us rejoice in welcoming our new king. The king would like... That is correct. Anything you want, and it's all free. Uhh, Pat, I'm not sure this is what being king is all about. Don't be ridiculous, Patrick. I'd never lie to you. Hi. By proclamation of the Royal Ministry, the king is entitled to get whatever he wants. Ok, thank you, sir. I'm sure King Patrick could use this walker. Yes, sire? Umm, his royal highness is building a royal Ferris Wheel. I know, isn't it great? Uh, right away, your majesty. Umm, Squidward? Umm, could I get you to sign this treaty promising your eternal loyalty to King Patrick? Patrick, what's happened to you? Uh... You know, Mr Krabs is probably wondering where I am...and... Um, well...it's just that, um, you're kinda being a jerk. Uh...well, I... Well, would you look at that. Gary, you're royalty! La la la la la. Missed ya. Uh-oh. You shouldn't play in the street, little guy. You could get run over. The "Ild Ones"! That's a strange name. Scallop! Bye "Ild Ones." I like your silly name. Hmm..."w." Oh, oh, they're not the "Ild Ones." They must be the "Wild Ones." No; I don't know who you are, either. Bloodthirsty bikers? And they're headed straight for Bikini Bottom! I've got to warn everybody! I better take the shortcut! Mr. Krabs! There's no time for that, Mr. Krabs. Grab something heavy! Bar the door! Board up the windows. We've got to protect the Krusty Krab. The Krabby Patties must survive! Bikers... coming... nasty... ferocious... take... over... town. Destroy... must hide! The Wild Ones are coming, Mr. Krabs. They're the most vicious, ravenous horde of hooligans in the sea. Mr. Krabs, this is serious! Squidward! A horrible biker gang called the "Wild Ones" are coming. We've got to run, hide! Uh-huh. Like this, Squidward? Patrick! Patrick, an evil gang of bikers are coming to ravage Bikini Bottom. Patrick, didn't you hear what I said? Hello, Patrick. No, hide me! Me! Me! Me! What? Their leather socks. Say that again, Patrick. No, no, not that part. The part about dressing up like big, scary bikers. What do you think, Patrick? Do I look tough? Nor I with you, my friend. Let's ride. Fear not. There is no need to panic. The Bikini Bottom bad boys are here. Patrick, it's working. They think we're... vicious bikers. Bikini Bottom, your salvation is here. Patrick, that's your salivation. So, Squidward, are you ready to do your part? Don't we look vicious and bloodthirsty? Oh, no thank you, Patrick. I'm drinking diet blood. See, Squidward? We walk the walk, but can we talk the talk? Do you want to join our biker gang? How about our biker organization? What about our coalition? We'll just pencil you down as undecided. Hi, Mr. Krabs. We're the Bikini Bottom bad boys and we're bad to the bone. Please, Mr. Krabs. We're going to run off those bikers and save the Krusty Krab. Then can we save the town? Squidward, when have I ever been known to over-react? Squidward! We're out of napkins! Out of napkins! Squidward! I accidentally removed the "Do Not Remove by Penalty of Law" tag on my mattress! Hide me! Hide me! Squidward! Squidward! I've gone blind! Oh. Thanks, Squidward. Me? Annoying? Yeah, right. Patrick, I know this looks like the end, but you and I can get through anything. As long as we do it together. Patrick? Patrick! Well, it's just you and me, Squidward. But I want you to know that we can get through this. As long as we... Mild Ones? Oh! Goodbye. They seem really nice. Hey, where's Squidward? Sorry, Mr Krabs, it's just that this KelpShake tastes so good. Look around ya. Everyone's enjoying a delicious KelpShake. Mm-mm. I'll be right back, Mr Krabs. I'm gonna get a refill. Hi, Mr Krabs. Hi...Plankton? Uh, Mr Krabs, I'm a little confused. Don't you and Plankton hate each other? Then why is he in your fist? Well, good luck with that. See ya. Mr Krabs, if you want a KelpShake, why don't you just buy one? What's happening to me? They've shutdown the KelpShake restaurants! You know, Patrick, the Jellyfish migration is my favorite time of year! For three whole days, jellyfish from around the globe gather on one spot to trade jelly secrets. Patrick, look! It's a blue-crested blaster! I've never seen one before! They're really rare. And a speckled squirter! A two fisted Jumper! And a gold-throated stinger! Oh, this year's migration is gonna be a big one! Wow. This looks like a job for Ol' Reliable! Ah, that was the most beautiful day of jellyfishing ever. Lucky for me, I have Ol' Reliable! Carbon fiber handle, titanium alloid netting and form-fitting silicone grips. Yes, sir, Ol' Reliable is the best net in the world. Good night, Patrick. Ah, I love jellyfishing. Whoo! Time to get ready for day two of the jellyfish migration. And I'll start with my trusty jellyfishing net, Ol' Reliable. Ol' Reliable? It's gone! Oh, right. Pants. Patrick, Ol' Reliable has been stolen! Put one over there, Patrick. Maybe we should spread out a little. Attention, Bikini Bottom, my jellyfishing net has been stolen. I am prepared to offer a large reward for its safe return. 12 dollars and... ...38 cents. Oh! Hello? Hello? Oh, get off the line, Patrick. Someone might be trying to call about Ol' Reliable! No, Patrick. Don't call unless you found my net. Hello?! What?! Really, Patrick? Oh, I'll never get my net back. I'll just have to accept that Ol' Reliable is gone forever. Patrick's lucky. He gets to practice in the middle of the night with his jellyfish net. Funny thing is, Patrick's net disintegrated yesterday. No, not yet. Hey, Patrick, wouldn't it be the funniest thing if you had taken my jellyfish net? Yeah, that would be silly. Oh, that reminds me. I got you a present. It's a Confess-A-Bear. He's a special friend you tell all your secrets to. I'll just leave you two alone to get acquainted. Patrick, we need to talk. Hmmm... Patrick, where are you? Why are the lights off? Ol' Reliable! Ah...ha. What's in your hand, Patrick? What's in your other hand? Well, I gotta go. Patrick wouldn't steal Ol' Reliable. Would he? Have I been best friends with a master thief? I must know for sure. Good morning, Patrick. What are you going to do today, buddy? Well, I'm off to work. See ya later, Patrick. Now, we'll just see what sort of nothing you're really up to, Sneaky McSneakyPants. Oh, he is good. You never really know a guy until you stare at him for eight hours through high-powered binoculars. Hey, where'd he go? Uh, you... what the...? What are you doing? I don't have any binoculars, see? I'm not acting weird! You're acting weird! You're... acting... weird! Greetings, young fellow! I am willing to pay top dollar for jellyfishing items with sentimental value, if you know what I mean. Word on the street is that you know where to get quality jellyfishing supplies hmm. Oh Mr. Star, I know that you are in possession of a rare jellyfishing net. I will pay one billion dollars for that net. Oh, really? And why not? A-ha! Patrick, I'm the scary mustache guy! Why did you steal my jellyfishing net?! You were my best friend, you no-good jellyfish net thief! Because you said it! You said that it was your friend SpongeBob's! What? For SpongeBob. You made me a new jellyfishing net? That is so thoughtful of you! Patrick? What'cha doing, best friend? Where are you going? Patrick, no! So, this is it? Patrick, don't go! I'm sorry I accused you! It's bad enough I lost my net. I don't want to lose my friend, too. Please forgive me. Ol' Reliable? I left you on the bus? Patrick, I want you to take this to remember me by. Oh, come here, you big lug! So did I. My best friend made it for me. Morning, Squidward. I waited for you to stop sleeping like you asked. So, you got any plans for the day, Squidward? Okay, Squidward, I'll catch ya later. Hi, Squidward, wanna play? Okay, Squidward, see ya later. Hey, Squidward, wanna play? Okay, Squidward, see ya later. Hey, Squidward, wanna play? Okay, Squidward, see ya later. Hi, Squidward, wanna play hide-and-seek? How 'bout a game of hangman? How about Duck, Duck, Hermit Krab? Hopscotch? Squidward Says? Steal the Bacon? Sleeping Sea Lions? Sharks & Minnows? Sink the Submarine? Kings & Queens? Mahjong? Whoa, I've never played this game before. What's it called? Something tells me Squidward doesn't wanna play today. That's it. If I can't play with the real Squidward... I'll just make one of my own! Just say hello to him, Squidward. You know how sensitive he is. Uhh, Squidward, he prefers to be addressed by his full name. How does he do it? Right again, Squiddy. You little charades master, you. Actually, Patrick, this is... Good one, Mini Squid! You are always such a ray of sunshine. Are you ready for another fabulous day of work at the Krusty Krab? Order up, Mini Squid! Here you go, pal! Go get em', tiger! Well, ol' Mini Squidward, I guess this is it. We've had some good times playing charades and dancing around like two giddy butterflies! Remember? But I guess it's time for you to move on, huh? Onto greener pastures. Arrivederci, mon frere. Bye-bye! What's the matter, actual-size Squidward? Yeah, I have something even better! Another me! ♪Mr. Sun came up, and he smiled at me. Said, "It's gonna be a good one just wait and see." Jumped out of bed and I ran outside feeling so extra ecstatified. It's the best day ever!♪ Hey, Gary. Why is this the best day ever you ask? Because, Gary, I get to start this wonderful day bringing life to a whole new generation of delicious Krabby Patties, followed by a vigorous mid-day session of karate with Sandy, and an afternoon jellyfishing with Patrick, where I'll unveil my newest, most prized possession: the Deluxe Jelly Slayer Composite Pro! And for the grand finale, every one of my closest friends joining together for Squidward's clarinet recital.

Wait ‘til Sandy gets a load of these adhesive karate gloves. Hyah! Hyah! Oh, just a little something I like to call karate. Mm-hmm. I see. Okay, then I'll come back later. Yeah? Oh. Oh. No Krabby Patties, no karate. At least I have jellyfishing with... Hey, there he is now! Wait for me, Patrick. I've got a brand-new... What's wrong, Patrick? Well, lucky for you, I brought my old net. Yeah, I won't be needing it now that I got my brand-new... Well, actually, Patrick, that's my brand-new net. Okay, Patrick, it's my turn, now. Hey, Patrick? Pat, old buddy. P-Patrick? It's-it's my turn now. I guess I'll see you at the concert. It's the best day ever. It's the best day ever. Oh, this best day ever isn't going so good. No work, no karate, no jellyfishing. Hey, I still have Squidward's concert! I won't let this one slip through my fingers. Hey, Squidward. Squidward, what's wrong? Pull yourself together, man! I came for here a concert, and darn it, I am gonna get one! Now play! I said play! Now get in there and give me a concert to remember. I'm going to see Squidward play his clarinet. Today's my best day ever. One ticket, coming right up, captain! Must be here somewhere. I don't have a ticket. But... SpongeBob, you are so... A reserved seat? Next to my friends? I made it! All I have to do is sit down... NO! (jumps on stage and tears the curtain) No! It is not over! This was supposed to be my perfect day. But then everything... SIT DOWN! Then everything turned to doo-doo. No, it's not okay! This was going to be my best day ever, starting with doing the best job in the world: working at the Krusty Krab. Yeah, I guess so. But then I was going to do karate with Sandy. Well, I suppose. But then I was going to go jellyfishing with Patrick. It's not? It is?

Patrick, I am truly honored and... You got me such an amazing gift, and all I got you was...that. Well, thanks for your appreciation, Patrick, but it's no giant, old, used ball of gum. No, not at all. O, majestic and much masticated Gummy, although I am not worthy to be in your presence, may my humble abode please you. Oh, you sure are a big boy, aren't you? Ooh. Hey, I know how to handle this. With a little karate! Hyah! Ooh. Oh, Gummy, what a beautiful centerpiece you make. With your dirty sock and used toothbrush, flies, and moldy pizza. Get a hold of yourself, SpongeBob. It's not so bad. After all, it is a gift from Patrick. I'm sorry, Patrick, but your gift has got to go! Goodbye, stink ball. See ya never! No way, Patrick. Well, you see, I liked Gummy and I decided to dress him up. Isn't this a cute look? Okay, no sign of Patrick. Better make this fast. Get ready for your dirt nap, Gummy! Uh... I was digging a hole so I could get a better view of Gummy because he is so attractive and... Allow me to demonstrate. See, Patrick, the view is beautiful down here! Thanks. Oh, what am I going to do, Gary? It's hideous. Wishful thinking, Gary. What burglar would want to steal that thing? Shhh. Uh, up there. Sandy. Hi, Sandy. Looks like I got myself into a sticky situation. All day. No, wait, Sandy. The more you touch it, the angrier it gets. Told ya. Save yourself, Sandy. Run away before you end up like me! Yeah, all righty. Now, Patrick, I can explain. Patrick, I have something to tell you. Uh, well, how can I put this? Patrick, do you miss your Gummy? Well, it's still Best Friends Day. How would you like your Gummy back? It's yours, buddy. But first, you got to get us out of this. Don't forget your condiments, Plankton. Safe! Why, Mr Krabs? Why does he hate us so? Best friends? Got your secret recipe, Mr. Krabs. You have no idea that went through to get here. Yeah, Mr. Krabs. What did happen next? It did happen that way, didn't it, Mr. Krabs? Gosh, Mr. Plankton, that doesn't sound like the Mr. Krabs story at all. Doesn't it just warm your heart, Karen? Sabotage! I'm adding the love! Well, I'm not here for the money. I'll always treasure these moments we had together. Awww... The Jim? He who flipped patties in the before times? Yeah. When this place had class... Well, we've had some good times, too. Right, Squidward? That's me! Yes, sir. Would you sign my Krabby Patty? Yeah. Not unless you look right in front of you! What's so great about a Jim Patty anyway? Meh, it's OK. Wow! That was... amazing! Uh, Mr. Jim, sir? I'm the new fry cook, sir. Do you have any tips you can pass on to a rookie? Please critique my work! I wish to learn at the feet of the master! Am I a fraud? Crying my eyes out. Why, Squidward? Don't worry, Squidward. Jim won't be leaving. He's taking my job. I'm the one who's leaving! The Krusty Krab deserves better than my meager skills. I should be professional. I must... resign. "Dear Mr. Krabs,..." Me? Goodbye, grill. Goodbye, pot. Goodbye, pan. So long, fry fat. Goodbye, grease stain. Goodbye, frozen patty #1. Goodbye, frozen patty #2. Goodbye, freezer. Look at them. Mr. Krabs is probably offering Jim my job right now. Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I was just leaving. I'm not fit to inhabit the same kitchen as Jim. So it is with a heavy heart that I relinquish my position as fry cook. But you're the greatest fry cook in the world! The Krusty Krab deserves better than me. Wow! I never thought about it that way! Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs. The Krusty Krab isn't a dump. Oh. "And slowly... Ever so slowly... The ancient crypt door creeps open... And from the festering brine of the darkest darkness, crawled forth monsters of such vile nature, whose appearance was so hideous and threatening, that the author died trying to recount them in this novel!" That story is so scary! But it's only a story, right, Gary? Why don't you sleep up here tonight, Gary? Well, I guess I should turn off the light now. Sure is dark. Oh, it's just a chair! I guess I'm imagining things in the dark. Whoa! Another monster! Oh, it's just a coral branch. Nothing to be scared of! What was that? Oh, it's nothing, Mr. Krabs. I just had a rough night. But it's nice and bright today! The dark! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!  Whenever I blink, I see nothing but the darkness! Great idea, Mr. Krabs. Yes, it's working... You want me to go in there? Save me, the darkness! Night light? Great idea, Mr. Krabs. Night light, night light... Oh! Oh, it's beautiful! Excuse me! Are these night lights guaranteed to keep the creepy creatures of the dark away? Now that I can see... Woo-hoo! I can sleep! I wonder what's in my dark, scary-looking bathroom! Night light! Night light! Oh, thank you, thank you! There, there, there, and there. I've been needing to change your tail light anyways, Gary. Now there's not one square inch of dark! What was that, Gary? You're right, Gary! I've got darkness inside of me! That was close, Patrick! You're safe under these night lights. But you can't go out in the dark, buddy! You don't know what kind of creepy critter could be lurking in those shadows! Wait, Patrick! What is that, Gary? Patrick, what are you doing!? You know what that means? Sleepover! Your sleeping bag, sir. Oh, Patrick! I'm so glad you made that gaping hole in the wall, letting in all t-t-t-t-t-t... The darkness, Patrick. I can feel it. Like it's creeping up on us... But, Squidward! Without our night lights, the creepy creatures of the dar- Patrick, what if Squidward's right? What if all this is all in our imagination? You said it, Pat! Mermaid Man!? Aww... Are you here to protect us from the darkness that surrounds us? Oh, I'm sorry, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. There appears to be a misunderstanding. You see, Patrick and I put up those lights to scare away the monsters in the dark! We weren't trying to summon you. Oh, my! Mermaid Man needs assistance! There is no need to fear, AbsorboPants is here! Say, let me help you! Is that enough light for you? Well, he's all taken care of. The Moth, silly! Your archenemy. You'll be happy to know he won't be going anywhere anytime soon! We're all alone, Patrick. No lights. No shelter. Pat! Come ba... Good...morning, Gary! Say, Gary, do you ever wonder what Patrick's mornings are like? Hey, Patrick, how was your morning? What's this? It says a free prize! Huh? Where's my prize? "Free Prize." "Offer inside"! Just send in 99 box tops! How you doing over there, Gary? Send in the box tops... ...before eating all the cereal?!? Gary, you are a genius! I'm waiting. I'm waiting. We're waiting. We're waiting for the mailman. He's bringing me a free toy. Why, sure. Yup. Isn't there anything else? Guess we'll have to keep waiting. Me, too. Great idea, Patrick. Krusty Krab, here we... wait a minute. What if the mailman comes when I'm gone? If I leave, the mailman might come and I might miss him. Got to stay focused. Not now, I'm busy. Oh, Gary, not now. Can't you see that I'm waiting for the mailman?! Doesn't anyone understand this?!? So tired. So hungry. But... must wait... for toy. What?! What do you want?! Can't you see I'm doing something here?! This better be good. My birthday party? I missed... my... birthday party? My birthday cake. That was my cake. What is the present? That stupid toy! I wasted my whole life waiting for it! I've been mean to Gary and I flipped Sandy, and now you hate me cause... I'm a big jerk! Yes, you do.  No, Patrick, people like me don't deserve moments. I get so caught up in... ...in waiting for... my toy! Whoo! Patrick, are you thinking what I'm thinking? I waited so long... And you broke it... Yes, yes I'm okay. You! You ruined my free toy! I-I ate... bo-bo-box tops. And then... I'm waiting. I'm waiting. And then he came and we're waiting. We're waiting. And then my toy and then you and then snap and then this. Hey, my toy's okay! Look, Patrick, Squidward fixed it. How can we ever thank you? Gary! What are you doing!? Oh my gosh! Your bowl is empty! Not to worry, Gare-gare! Food is on the way, faster than you can say organic! There you go, Gary! Gary! Shame on you! I realize you're a bottom feeder, but have some manners! You know you're not supposed to eat goop off the ground! Now go on and enjoy your health food! What is this stuff, anyway? It doesn't seem to be coming off! Ooh! Company! Is something wrong, Patrick? What's what? Ow! P-P-P-Patrick, what should I do? Good idea! Yeah? What makes you say that? Ay-yi-yi! It's getting bigger! Nothing a little pimple cream can't cure! That's more like it! All better. See, Patrick? Bye, Patrick! Ahh… This feels better! Let's see. A four-letter word, ooh. Meaning of uncomfortable sensation on the dermis… Hmm… Itch! Don't worry, SpongeBob. Everyone gets itchy, swelling skin rash now and then. Just don't scratch it and it'll go away… Eventually. There! Outta sight, outta mind! Huh? I won't let this minor setback hinder my fry cooking! Now nothing can distract me from frying up those patties… Except maybe this unbearable itchiness! Must… Stop… Scratching! Huh? Oh, hi, Squidward! All what-y? Oh, that! It's nothing really, Squidward… Just a little blemish, that's all! Help… Me! What's going on, Squidward? Help! Where am I? Whoa! Who are you people? I wanna go home! Where's my snail, Gary? Gary? Whoa! Patrick! Stop! Stop! You're gonna pop it! Oh, Patrick! How many times do I have to tell you?! Be careful! Sure! Let's begin! Um... Patrick? Patrick? Patrick! What am I gonna do? My bubble is destroyed. There is no time for games, Pat! Now think, SpongeBob! The fate of Bikini Bottom rests in your hands! Patrick, you're a genius! And this one's mobile! Now I can go back to work! Sorry I'm late, Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob SquarePants, returning for duty, sir. Ohhhh, noo! Stop! You're pushing out more of the Ick! NOOOOO! Gary the Snail! Don't you know it's impolite to feed off of other people without permission? Here you go, Mr. Krabs! Look, Gary! You made me all sparkly! You're the best bottom feeder a sponge could ever have! What are you doing, Mr. Krabs? Spy?! Whoo-ooh-ooh! Patrick, I'm going to be a spy. In my hands. Ooh! Get rid of it! Get rid of it, Patrick! Hey, Sandy. Do you know anything about spying, Sandy? Wow, Sandy, with these gadgets, Patrick and I will be great spies. What do we do now, Patrick? Nothing yet. Wait! Wait! He's... ...buying baby clothes? We gotta get closer. Wow, Plankton has to buy baby clothes? SpongeBob to Krabs. Come in Krabs. Plankton just bought some baby clothes. Hold on. He's buying... A... stamp. We're right behind him, and he has no idea! I can't tell. He's getting away! Quick, Patrick, use the jet-packs! Boy, it was lucky the sidewalk broke our fall. But we've lost Plankton! Hmmm... mines, oil slick, smoke screen, shield... Agent SpongeBob here. I'm afraid we've lost him, Mr. Krabs. You're not paying me at all, Mr. Krabs. Okay, Patrick, we're in position. Now how do we get inside? Spies don't use the front door, Patrick. We've got to figure out a complicated way to get inside. Good work, Patrick! Now it's my turn. I thought you were holding the rope -- Can't you go later? It's up to you and me, buddy! Not to rain on your parade or anything, but you always lose. Mr. Krabs? But if you're Mr. Krabs, then who's... Mr. Krabs is a robot! Plankton?! What the barnacles is going on here? Squidward? Then who are you? Hmmm, if he's Squidward, then you must be... ...Sandy? You're me! Then I must be... Nah, I'm just kidding. Good one, Patrick! There's just one thing I don't understand. That. Hey, Squidward! Look at what I can do with my feet! Ah, perfect. Mirrors? Oh, that reminds me. I haven't adjusted this one yet. Hi there! How's it going? Lalalalalalalalala! Whee! Hi, Squidward. Hi, Mrs. Puff. Looks like you guys forgot your boat smarts! Exciting reading, Mr. Krabs? Hi, Sally! Hi, Sadie! Hi, Shubie! Right back at you, Lenny! Oh, sure, Squidward. I can't see anything in here, Squidward. Hi, Thaddeus! Gus! Well, I simply compile the name of every customer in this book. Oh, that's-- that's-- I know him. It's-- something. Hey, Squidward. See you on the outside in ten years, buddy. Got to hurry, Gary. The sooner I get to bed, the sooner I'll get to sleep, and the sooner I get to sleep, the sooner I'll wake up, and the sooner I wake up, ooh ho-ho! The sooner I get to go to work at the best job in the whole wide world: The Krusty Krab! Now, to just put on these sleepy time blinders, before I run excitedly to bed. Well, good night, Gary. I'm just going to turn out the lights. Clickety poo. And close my eyes and go to sleep. Just close my eyes and go to sleep. ...just close my... Maybe if I run around it'll tire me out. Oh, I just got to get some sleep! There's only one thing for this. Ah, that's the stuff. A glass of warm snail milk. Dah! Why isn't it working-- Whoa, Gary, what happened? Agh, I'm late for work! Oh, my gosh, only twenty seconds to go! What the...? Bridge out? Hopscotch! Almost there. No! I'm late. What's Mr. Krabs going to say? TardyPants! You, sir, are a TardyPants! Wait 'till Mr. Krabs finds out. You better think of something to save your job. Order up! Here you go, sir. One Krabby Patty, Krabby Fries, and Krabby Drink in three seconds flat. I'm on it! Nothing a dedicated, on-time employee can't handle. Kiddies get a free touch-up. All done! No! Please don't throw me out in the street! I am so sorry for what I did. I was a minute late for work! A whole 60 seconds. No! No! You have to punish me! Thank you, sir. I will. I love it here, Mr. Krabs. Somethin's not right. What is it? Do I miss my old clock? Maybe it's my old bed. Oh, that's it. I'll make the Krusty Krab just like home. What do you say Gary? SpongeBob reporting for duty, sir. All night, sir. That's right, I'm going to live here from now on, so I'll never ever be tardy pants again. Here's my first month's rent. Already done, sir. Done. All that, before we even open up our doors, sir. Eww, I guess I could use some freshening up. Ooh. Hi, Squidward. Oh, I live here now. No, at the Krusty Krab. Now, if you'll excuse me. Won't you miss me living next door, Squidward? Well, I had to put them somewhere and my underwear drawer is all filled up with Krabby Patties and the freezer is filled up with my iced snowflake collection. So I put the cash from the cash register in the pickle jar. Do you want to know where the mustard is? Laundry song, la-la-la! Sing about your laundry all day long. La-la-la-la laundry song. Well, they don't see to mind. Aye aye, captain. It was getting kind of crowded in the kitchen. So I moved in here. But I'll only be here at night. Please, Mr. Krabs, I won't get in your way. Please! Oh, thank you, Mr... My parents! Mom! Dad! Come on in. And this is the guest room. Mom, Dad, Mr. Krabs. Well, I'll let you two get settled. Gary! Bad boy! No! Oh, Mr. Krabs kicked me out, so now we're neighbors again. Hey, my drums! Not if you get up and exercise! Hut, two. Hut, two. Yes, sir. my buns are nice and toasty. You're welcome, Squidward. Yeah! Your yard is really fun! There are kids playing on it right now! Hippo what-ia? What does that mean? That's why I wore mittens. Mm. Toasty! Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs. Pardon me. Yes, sir. Can do, Mr. Krabs. Order up! Coming right up, sir. Yes, sir. Coming through! Hi, Patrick. Holy shrimp! Plankton! Not quite, Plankton. You'll have to get past me, first. You're mine now, Plankton! You won't get away with this, Plankton. Oh, my weekend was fabulous. Thank you for asking. Patrick and I went jellyfishing but I lost my net. So, I tried to borrow one from Squidward, but he didn't have one. And then when he yelled at me, he swallowed a bug. Swallowed a bug. Hey! Hold it right there, mister! Got you, Plankton. The clamboni! Um, thank you, Mr. Krabs. Here's your Krabby Patty and lemonade, Mr. Krabs. And then, the ugly mollusk ran all the way home... Glove World! Roller coaster. First in line. Excuse me, which way to the Fist O' Pain? In the name of amusement, no...! I don't want to ride the Fiery Fist O' Pain! No! Well, yeah. It's just that I had a bad dream last night. What was your dream about, Patrick? Wait for me, Patrick. Whoo! Fiery Fist O' Pain, here we come. Boy, the Fist O' Pain sounds... Yeah, really fun. That sure looks like fun. No tickets. I must have left it at home. I guess we're not gonna be riding the Fist O' Pain today. Oh, barnacles!. It sure was lucky we found our tickets. There it is. The line looks awfully long. Yeah, and then the Fist O' Pain will seem even cooler. Can you believe some people are afraid to ride roller coasters? I can't believe it, Patrick. It's Glovey Glove! Get over there and I'll take your picture with him. Get closer, Patrick. Come on, closer. That's it, a little more. Now hold onto his thumb. Give me a big smile. I mean, The Mitten. Yeah. Let's ride it just to see how baby-fied it is. Well, the line looks a little bit shorter now. Can you believe that some people are scared of this ride? We've gone eight times. Bye. Hello, Larry. Oh, it's, uh... very manly, Larry. Um, I have a confession to make. We haven't gone on the ride because I'm... hungry. I'm very hungry. Hungry, hungry! No thanks, Patrick. Um, you got ice cream in your eyebrows. Hurry back so we can go on the ride. Oh, delicious dairy treat, I don't know what to do. I know, but the ride is really scary. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Ow, quit it! Ow, quit it! Ow, quit it! I have to tell you something too, Patrick. Warning! This ride may cause: Crying, screaming, projectile vomiting, amnesia, spine loss, embarrassing accidents, uncontrollable gas... Is that all? Well, this is it, Pat. On the Fiery Fist O' Pain. We made it. This is it, Patrick. We made it! We're not crybabies. Patrick, I have a confession to make. I was really scared about going on this ride. I didn't know how to tell you because, well, I didn't want to disappoint you. But now we don't have to face our fears. The ride is broken. Patrick, I don't want to face my fears. I'm afraid of them! Goodbye, Patrick. We conquered our fears! We survived the Fist o' Pain! Let's go again! Aw. well, we can help you. Right, Patrick? Oh. hi, Squidward. Looky, Mr. Plankton's having us paint. He calls it pizzazz. Let's show him Mr. Plankton? All this hard work is making us thirsty. Do you think we can get-- --a drink? I see what you mean. La-la-la-la-la-la-la. La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. Hey, Plankton? What do you think of the new window? We got it from The Krusty Krab. I guess I hadn't thought about that. Oh. It's okay, little green—creature. Patrick and I are going to keep working on The Chum Bucket. until it's the most pizzazziest restaurant in Bikini Bottom. And how. Come on, fellows. Let's do some interior decorating. I know. Isn't it great? It looks just like The Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs! You've returned from your vacation. ♪Someday, I'm going to make you sweetie. Not overtly, but sur-rep-titious-ly.♪ Drum solo! ♪Dooga, dooga, dooga, dooga, dooga—doo. Doo, doo, doo, Doo. Doo!♪ Hey, looks like you guys and gals are done. In all my years of fry cookery, I have never seen a group of patties. Especially— you. Such perfection from your little lettuce hair to your rosy ketchup cheeks right down to your mustard smile. May I call you— Patty? Here you go, Squidward. One, two, three and four, and uh— five and six. That's it. That's the whole order, Squidward. There isn't a Krabby Patty behind my back or anything. Oh, Patty, a patty like you comes around once in a lifetime. I can't let them eat you. No, the job must come first. I can't let emotions cloud my commitment to the sacred fry cook oath: "That which is fried, must be eaten." I won't let you do this to Patty. Oh, Patty, I can't let them eat you. Your beauty must be preserved. Amazing. Great idea. Enjoy, sir. What's cooking there, Patty? Oh, are you kidding? I love crepes. Oh, Patty, when we're together, I feel like we're in our own little world like, like— nothing can hurt us. Fire! Fire! Fire! It's okay, Patty, the fire's gone. You're safe now. Oh, I better, uh— get the doorbell. Sorry, Patrick. I already made plans to go for a walk through Jellyfish Fields with Patty. As soon as the little lady dries her hair, we're heading out. Sorry, Sandy. No time for karate today. After our walk, I'm going for a rowboat ride with Patty. Just waiting for her to put on her makeup. You know how long it takes a Krabby Patty to get ready. Patty. Yeah, well, you two have fun with that. Patty and I have to be on our way. ♪Oh, baby. They may call me a fool. But I can't help our gravitational pull. When I stuff you with cotton candy, it reminds me you're so sweet. When we go riding, it's dandy. The way you hang onto that seat. Ba-ay-ay-by.♪ ♪When I'm with you, Our love is stronger than glue. Oh, baby! There isn't anything. There's nothing in the world, I wouldn't do for you—♪ Hey, let go of her, you Patty-eaters! No! Get away! Hi-yah! Hi-yah! Hi-yah! Hi-yah! Hi-yah! Yah! Yah! Hi-yah!

That's why I'm singing this song. Ba-ay-ay-by. Your looks are sweeter than honey. From your pickles to your buns. It ain't even funny—!♪ I'm coming for you! Oh, no! Look at you! Don't worry, Patty! I'll take care of this! There you go! ♪All better— Oh, baby!♪ Oh, Patty. Do you realize what this signifies? Mm-hmm. That's right. It's our six-hour anniversary. And do you know what that means? Are you all right, Patty? You don't seem so hot. Don't worry, I know what'll make you feel better. A dinner at the finest restaurant in Bikini Bottom. Good day, sir. Oh, I just got gussied up for my special dinner date. She's rich in taste. There she is. Here we are, darling. The best eatery in town. Mr. Krabs, Squidward— allow me to introduce my date— Patty. This isn't a “piece-o-meat”, Mr. Krabs. She's Patty. And we're on a special date tonight so you don't mind if we get the "manager's treatment," do you? Oh, really? Mr. Fiver says different. How about now? Grrrrrazie! Here you go, my dear. A throne befitting a queen. Oh, good evening, monsieur. What might we have on the menu at this fine establishment? Don't say such a thing, Squidward. Patty's just a little sick is all. Wight, Wubbie-Lubbie. Squidward, what are you doing with my beautiful patty? Stop it, Squidward! Maybe you can't see Patty's beauty. But to me, she's the most gorgeous creature in the sea. Patty, you no mind to that, wubbie-wubbie. I will always love you— Yeah, what is that smell? Patty? What happened to you? Um, not quite, Mr. Krabs. I see now. I see what I must do. Oh, Patty, my darling. Before I do this, I want you to know that I only do it out of love. Can I get a doggie bag with that? Sorry, Patrick. We're all out. Patrick! Waiting to watch the sunrise with you. Uh-huh. We come here every morning. Uh-huh. Ah, the memories we've shared, right in this room. They're all here in this memory book. Here we are on the Fourth of July. And Valentine's Day. Oh, you looked so cute on Easter. What's wrong with Squidward? Can I tell it this time, Squidward? Pretty please? Whenever Squidward sees us, the storm clouds in his brain roll in and a nasty storm rages. So, Squidward's happy gland is forced to take shelter in the recesses of his mind. But the happy gland can't find a recess deep enough, so he gets the flu and has to stay in bed until we leave. Squidward? Uh, Squidward? Thanks for sharing this moment with us, Squidward. Wow, that's a nice one. Thanks for inviting us to your big fencewarming party. Oh, this is so neat. Let's do it again. But-- You're not mad at us, are you, Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Well, okay then. You look like you need some alone time. We'll be at the petting zoo if you need us. Yeah, they're pretty adorable. Oh, yeah. Hey, Patrick. Did you notice anything different about Squidward? No, no. I mean he seems happier. Squidward, what are you doing here? Oh, yeah. I forgot. The new Squidward. I guess I better get ready for work. Boy, the new Squidward sure is friendly. The new Squidward sure is helpful. Huh? The new Squidward sure is hygienic. Boy—the new Squidward sure is chummy. Ah, this is more like it. Just me, my grill, and you, Mr. Smiley Face Krabby Patty. No one can come between us. S-S-Squidward! Aren't you supposed to be out front? What? Oh, that's silly talk, Squidward. I'm chief fry cook, and we fry cooks work alone. And, uh-- --we're not supposed to get distracted while we're cooking, Squidward! Whoa! Squidward, what are you doing? Oh, these will never do. Besides, it takes years of practice and you'd never be up to it. Oh, these are no good, Mr. Krabs. Squidward made them. But he's not a real fry cook. Actually, Squidward, in point of fact, I've been Employee of the Month a gazillion and six times. Keep dreaming. Yes, Mr. Krabs? What's wrong with it? Dimples? It was him! No, Squidward did it. The guy you're looking for is over there. Yes? Mm-hmm? Okay. It's okay, Squidward. It's a very okay cake. Oh, so what if New Squidward is a better cook than you? Doesn't matter. And so what if Squidward replaced you as Employee of the Month? And so what if New Squidward is pogo-dancing with your best friend? Pogo-dancing with your best friend?! Stop! Maybe you can take my job! And maybe you can take my place on the employee of the month wall of fame! But nobody, and I mean nobody, pogo dances with that guybut me! "he confiscates Squidward's pogo stick]" Now do yourself a big fat favor and get out, bub! You know, Patrick. maybe I was a little hard on New Squidward. I mean, he might be a good fry cook. and he might have his picture on the wall, but I still have the best friend in the world I know. I'll go apologize. Come on. Squidward, I just want to say I'm sorry for being so selfish, and yelling at you and all. I mean, who cares about cooking, pictures on the wall and dancing. We're bigger than that, right? So, if you're willing to let bygones be bygones, then I'm willing to meet you half way. What do you say, buddy? Put her there. Oh, I'll just meet you all the way. Lay one on me, pal. What are you talking about? May I help you, sir? As soon as the present customers are done with it. They like to chew their food thoroughly. How will that help them chew faster? No problem, I was just telling this customer he needed to wait for his favorite table. Why did you give him the table? I didn't know money could talk. Did it tell you to kick those old people out? What do you have against old people? Wouldn't it be neat if money could talk? I think Mr. Krabs is gonna sing. I really have to pee. Hello... money. I'm starting to worry about Mr Krabs. Mr. Krabs, lookin' good. I don't know. He's acting kind of weird. Hi, Mr. Krabs. I just came by to make sure you weren't, you know, totally insane. Okay, glad you're not insane. He was five bucks short on payday. I challenge your gadget. I declare patty war! I won't be defeated! I won't lose to that thing! Foul beast, do your worst! Whoo, yeah! Sorry, Squidward, you got to go lower to win. We're limbo dancing to get ready for the dance-a-thon auditions. You built us a trophy case for when we win? Oh, you are a true friend. I think we better raise the bar. We're up, Patrick. Wish us luck, Squidward. You kidder. Let's go, Patrick. Well, see you at the finals tomorrow, Squidward. Yep. You're just not getting into the spirit of this thing, Squidward. How'd the audition go, Squidward? Impressive. Hey, Squidward, would you be our coach for the finals? Yes, yes I am. Ready! How'd you know? I guess they're happy. Gee, Squidward, with your arms and legs doing all the work, I'm not really doing anything. I think I should help. Well, I just... You know what, Squidward? I think I'm suffering for my art now. Good gravy. Get a load of the talent here. Oh my goodness. I am honored to be in the presence of such divine talent. Now, before I begin, let me just thank you all for coming out tonight. Wow, Squidward, the crowd's gone silent. Uh, Squidward? Um, Squidward, is this part of the act? Oh, thank you, you're too kind. But I couldn't have done it without a very special someone. I love your new dance, Patrick. Well, back to work. La, la, la, la, la, la! Wow. Good morning, sir. What's with the new sign? Oh. you mean like when Squidward had that mole taken of his— Morning, Squidward. Ooh! Squidward, where did you find those shoes? Captain! My spatula's missing, sir! Okay, Mr. Krabs. I really think I should be getting back to the grill, now. All aboard. Oh, boy. What a day. What's next? A zombie invasion? Mr. Krabs, open up! We're being attacked by a bunch of zombies that look like me! Please, you don't understand! They're all splotchy and yellow with distended bellies! Open up, open up, open up, open up! Mr. Krabs? Wait! They're not zombies, Mr. Krabs. They're your customers— look! Mr. Krabs, what have you done?! You poisoned all these people! Sure is glad to be back behind the grill where I belong, Mr. Krabs. Are ya ready to go, Patrick? Patrick, it's me! Ew, what's this? It's an ad. Dear Comic Book Reader. Have you ever thought about turning one of your poems into a hit song on the radio? Send in your poem and $100 and we'll make it a hit! Can we go now? My arms are getting tired. You can't always trust ads in comic books. Those X-Ray specs I ordered couldn't see through people's skin at all! Only their clothes! Plus, you don't have $100. Patrick, could you get my wallet? Hey, that's my comic book money! Patrick. No. Ow! Can I have my arms back? Good luck. Coming-- You have to think of the words yourself. Oh, Patrick! Why would I hit you with a dodgeball? No! You can play your records later, Gary. Patrick, is that why you've been having trouble writing? Oh, I don't even own a dodgeball. Do you, Gary? That's the spirit, Patrick! I'll open a window. Patrick, don't strain yourself. Come on, let's hear it! I don't see any dodgeballs here buddy. Just an artist and his work. Uh, Patrick? It's really loud! oh...hmm... how do I put this delicately-- That was the best song I ever heard! We need to get that song on the radio! Darn, I just got that arm back. Did you see the look on his face? I didn't know they could turn inside out like that. Now, how are we going to get your record on the radio? I got an idea! We just have to play your record from the top of this antenna. Huh? Patrick--  Well, it looks like Bikini Bottom is throwing a party. and you know what a party needs. Yes, that is important. But I was thinking about music! Turn it up, Patrick! Look at that, Patrick! That's not an angry mob, Patrick. It's your fan club! Why, he's right here. Patrick Star, Musical Genius. Yes, there is, Patrick. Sandy's been gone for two whole days. Oh, why'd she have to go to that science convention in Tejas?! She won't be back for one more hour, 26 minutes and 47 seconds. Patrick, that's Squidward. He's not gone, he's right here. I sure do miss that squirrel. Her karate chopping, that ten-gallon glass dome over her dome. And who can forget those buck teeth? After Sandy gets back, we're gonna let her know just how much we miss her. No, Patrick, that's your mother. But that does give me an idea. We'll throw Sandy the mother of all welcome home parties! Patrick, to the treedome! Ah. Huh? We've readied this place for Sandy's arrival, which should be about... ...Whoo, right now. Welcome home, Sandy, you know that we missed ya. That's quite alright, Miss Cheeks. As long you don't have a fierce no-partying policy. First, cake, then we'll karate-chop, and then... I knew it! You have been itching to see us. Maybe a slice of cake will take your mind off of your crawling hide. Patrick and I made this cake especially for your return. Dig in, Sandy. Uh... Are you okay, Sandy? Uh.. Hey, Sandy. Sandy. Surprise! Patrick and I chipped in and got ya' a little somethin' somethin'. Don't you mean ride this down Scab Mountain? Uh, you're welcome, Sandy. Hey, uh, are you still up for some karate chops? Ya ready? And how 'bout now? You ready? What's a flea? He tickles! Oh, this isn't so bad! Ow! He bit me! Got any more of those fancy collars, Sandy? Nyahh! Oh! Sandy, please help me! I need it more! Um, is that what over looks like? Whoa! Aah! Uh, thanks for having us, Sandy, but we gotta go. Sandy! Oh, no! Are you okay? Wait a minute! You had as much to do with this party as I did! Stop smudging my helmet! Is this how we will spend the rest of our lives? Living in fleas instead of water? It sure is good to have you back, Sandy! Would you like another spot of tea, Ms. Nibsy? Oh, you would? A donut this nice could really make a guy happy! Hey, Patrick. Hey, Star. It's SquarePants. That was some party last night, huh, buddy? That's exactly how I feel about it. Luckily, I videotaped the whole party so we can relive it over and over and over again. I'm waiting to watch it with you, Sillyfish! I'll be right over. Sheesh, Patrick's so excited, I better not keep him waiting! Hey, Patrick, I- Donut! You monster...! You monster! Nothing goes with a video like toast! Let's pop some toast in the toaster and watch this bad boy! Get out of the way, Patrick, I gotta go! Hey, Patrick! Are you ready to- Okay... No problem. Ready to see this? The official testament of how heartily we party... hardy? Oh, Patrick! You really need to see this video! I wanna give you this, because you're my buddy and... A donut this nice could really make a guy happy... Of course! It was your birthday! Last night, silly! Sure, pal! There ya go, little buddy. Now everybody's all clean and ready for beddy-bye. All ready, Mr. Krabs. Just gotta clock out and... Spot, spot, spot! ...till everything's ship-shape, sir. Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I'll get this plate cleaned up in a jiffy. Lock up? Wait, Mr. Krabs. Don't you remember what happened last time you left me here alone? Aye-aye, sir. La-la-la-la-la-la-la. You're a tough little guy, aren't ya? This means war. Wait here, please. Say good-night, dried on filth. Ready. Aim. Fire! That is the last straw! I want you to remember... you made me do this. Yaahhhh! I got to finish this. I'm afraid this is the last time we'll be meeting like this, my friend. Allow me to introduce you to... the Spot-Master 6000. Notice, the microwave-powered laser particle beam. Notice, the laser-guided high pressure water cannon. And notice, the little surprise I installed just for you. A specially woven metal alloy ingeniously combined with state of the art cleaning materials. I call it... ...steel wool! And it comes with... a laser! Any last words? Mmm... I thought not. Power up. Water cannon... on. No effect. Steel wool laser... on! OK, you asked for it. It may end life as we know it, but I am crossing the beams! More power! More power! More power! Maximum power! Ahhhhh! The platter's all clean, Mr. Krabs. Wooo-ooo! Hey, a baby! What are you doing out here all alone, baby? I'll take charge of you until your mommy shows up! Oh, aren't you just too cute. Coochie coochie coo! Oh, sure thing, Plankton. Here you go, little guy. Police! Police! Oh, Squidward. Thank Neptune you're here. I found this baby all alone. But he wasn't really alone, he was with Plankton! And he's not a baby! It's Mr. Krabs! Plankton turned him into an infant so he could steal the Krabby Patty formula! What do we do, Squidward? Aw, what's wrong, Mr. Baby Krabs? Are you thirsty? That's it, drink up! Okay, maybe you're hungry? How about a nice soft Krabby Patty? Yikes. Not even a Krabby Patty helps. How about a stack of 20s? Plankton! Hold it right there! Old people are out greatest natural resource! I salute you, elder citizenry! I remember when a quarter used to cost a nickel. What was that, sonny? What? Catch who? Come back here, you little whippersnapper! I'm catching up with my knitting. What's wrong, little feller? Order up! Go now, and bless the taste buds of your lucky connoisseur. Well, okay, you sit this one out, Squidward, this will be a special delivery from the chef. For your dining pleasure, two double Krabby Patties cooked to perfection complimented by a side of coral bits and a jumbo diet soda, topped off with a little extra love. Enjoy your meal! It's the little details that they really appreciate, isn't it, Squidward? Nothing beats making quality food for good people with discriminating tastes. Yeah! Uh-huh. Testify! Squidward! The Krusty clientèle needs to be cuddled and treated with respect. There, there. Mr. Krabs will be ashamed! Mr. Krabs? What's happening, Mr. Krabs? Chef exchange program? Um, right here, sir. I'm sure with all my years in the kitchen, I can make something other than... Just warming up. Come on, SpongeBob! Just one egg then... No, that's not it, no... A Krabby Patty. Well, my time here is up. I am officially a Krusty Krab employee once again! The Krabby Patties, I almost forgot! These babies also belong to the Krusty Krab! So long! I'm sorry, but I've got to go. Mr. Krabs? Mr. Kra-a-abs?! Mr. Krabs! Ahoy, Mr. Krabs! You got it, Mr. Krabs. Hurry, Patrick, hurry! How's it look, buddy? Ready for the old scrapbook? Okay, Patrick, this one's gonna be a masterpiece. Hold on a second, Patrick! It's not the poor camera's fault you can't get a photo. No, it is the very nature of the fragile bubble. Yes, it is, my friend.

Let's take this to the Bikini Bottom museum, they'll know what it is! We were just... No. Squidward, we'd never... What's an Atlantean omelet? Why is this bubble painted on the mural?

Excuse me, sir, this tour has been great and all, but uh, can we see the bubble now? There it is Patrick! Look at it, Patrick! So ancient, so floaty. It is the most beautiful, wrinkled up, dusty old bubble I've ever seen! Thank you, Mr. Lord Royal Highness, sir. Just look at it, Patrick. Ah the stories this bubble could tell. I just wish we could get a closer look. Patrick! Get the-- Whoo, that was a close one buddy! Boy, that would have been out greatest blunder without a doubt! But we should go before something bad does happen. Great idea, Patrick! Patrick, did you hear something? Mmm-hmm. We have to go back to Bikini Bottom now! We have to go home now! Because, uh, Gary misses me? It's not a joke, we burst the bubble! That tickles! Patchy, it's me. SpongeBob SquarePants. Don't lose hope. Everything will be all right when you get to Encino.

Fine, not to worry, no problem. I'm ready, again! It's time to take an elective approach. Good morning Squidward! I'd love to stop and chat right now, but it's Picture Day and- Still looking good Spongy, and Boating School is just around the corner. Ketchup? Wait, wait, don't squirt! Please, you've got to spare me. I've got picture day today. Well, I'm not sure how I did it, but I... And now, as an extra precaution to keep me looking shiny and new... No grime can penetrate the glossy sheen of Sponge Gloss. There it is. So close, and still so shiny. Hey, it's just water. Stamps? all over me! Oatmeal? Glue. Patrick, a little privacy here. Well, go ahead, but I don't have time to play right now. I am late for picture day, and I just can't seem to get to school without being covered by unsightly debris. If only I had a sealed barrier to protect me from the filth of the outside world. Ew! That's it! This jelly jar will insulate me from the dirty dregs of Bikini Bottom. If you don't mind, Patrick, we don't have much time. Uh, Patrick... No, no, no, no, no, Patrick! I'm not jelly, I'm not jelly! Patrick, I just wanted to take a decent picture today because someday, I will graduate from Boating School and I don't want to be remembered as the guy covered in peanut butter and taco shells! Wait, can I go home and change first? Cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese! I can't stop crying! Cheese. There I am. Hey, I don't look so bad after all! I think I can explain. Yes, I've seen this one before. It's a common symptom. Patrick is suffering from Krabby Patty Withdrawal. He needs one, or he'll keep mumbling about it for the next 3-1/2 minutes. Okie dokie, Mr. Krabs. Patrick, what's up, buddy? That's because you didn't hit the trash compactor switch. Patrick, that's not a... trash bag. Thank you, Mr. Postman. Thanks, Gary. Hm, can't read the return address. Maybe this will shed some light. Hey, SpongeBob, it's your cousin BlackJack. Guess what? I'm out of prison and decided to pay your parents a visit. If you want to see them again, meet me for a wrestling match at their house. Try it little man. Blackjack. Cousin Blackjack's out of prison!? That's right, Gary, the cousin Blackjack. The same cousin Blackjack that used to beat me up all the time when we were kids. Oh, no. That was years ago, Gary. My sentiments exactly. Just imagine what he must look like now. That brute has my parents. I gotta get over there. Gary, I don't know how long I'll be gone. I don't know if I'll ever come back. I may get beaten to a quivering pulp but I must do it, for the sake of my parents. Oh, my gosh, what happened to my parents' house? What's this? "Do not cross"? Is that police tape? There's only one reason for the police being here: a crime has been committed. No! Get it together, SquarePants. To face Blackjack, you've got to be as tough as nails. Huh? What?! All the furniture is covered in plastic. The police must have covered everything to preserve the crime scene. What could have happened here? What's this? Blackjack smashed my family portrait. Oh, no. What has he done with my parents? That fiend. Where did he take them? I must find more evidence. What's this? Another note. SpongeBob, I paid your parents a visit. Now, I'm gonna do the same with Gramma! You better hurry, little man-boy. BlackJack. He's gonna get Grandma, too. I have to stop him. Grandma! Where are you? Are you ok? Grandma? You in here? Grandma? Oh, no, I'm too late! He burnt you to a crisp. Oh, that animal. Grandma? Are you talking to me from beyond the beyond? But where's Blackjack? Loose ends. My parents! He's tied them up? Cleaning up the mess? I got to get help. I'll go to Uncle Captain Blue's. He'll know what to do. Uncle Captain Blue, I need your help. I need you to help me rescue my parents. Uncle Captain Blue, I need to help my parents. They're in danger. Actually, I came to try to find my... Uncle Captain Blue, Uncle Captain Blue? Please help me. I am desperately searching for my mommy and daddy! Listen, Uncle Captain Blue. We don't have much time. Cousin Blackjack has my parents help captive at his house. That's why we have to rescue them now! But, Uncle Captain Blue, I need the help of a crime fighter like you. You mean they won't give me a push on the swing set? Nice wormy, nice wormy. Nice wormy. Uncle Captain Blue is right. I'm not cut out for this. I should just turn around and go home. Mother! Mom? They're trapped in the basement. Mom, dad, quick! Let's get out of here. Party? The fumigator's? So that wasn't a crime scene I saw at your house? So, you two aren't being tortured by cousin Blackjack? To quiver. Come on, Little Bobby. Don't let him beat you. You've got to stand up for yourself this time. That's it! I am not gonna take this anymore. I am putting my foot down. You wanna tussle? Well, let's tussle it up! Cousin Blackjack? That tickles. Yeah, Blackjack, you haven't changed a bit. Hey, yah! Whoa! Hup. There, there. You're safe now, little lady. So, we meet again, Crazyfish! With pleasure! You ready to get crazy, huh, Crazyfish?! Sorry, I'm not wearing any frosting. Hey, that's cheating! Yes, it is! Yes, it is! Is too! Is too! Is too! Is not! Is not! Don't worry! I'm ready! Bring it on! Oh, good morning, Gare-bear. I kept you up all night with my nocturnal outbursts? Again? No, no, Tuesday night was the one with the 30-foot librarian. Last night was the one where I defeat notorious arch-villain Jack M. Crazyfish. Using the sheer force of my awesomely developed musculature. Whew, what a relief. For a second there, I thought I gave myself a black... ...eye. Go away, Gary. I'm busy... wallowing! I did something so dumb to myself that even you would laugh uncontrollably at me. You promise you won't laugh? Okay, here goes. Gary, I gave myself a black eye trying to open the toothpaste. Thanks for not laughing, Gare. I knew you'd... Gare...? No, no, it's okay, Patrick. He... uh, he learned his lesson. Hmm... Jack M. Crazyfish. You've never seen anyone like this guy, Patrick. He was about 60 feet tall. He was big and mean. Oh, but ol' SpongeBob here knows how to teach a lummox some manners. I handled him the same way I handle all enormous muscle-bound villains. Uh, no, with a little hi-yah! and a ka-zow! and a gallon of hi-yah, hi-yah, ha! Yeah, he never knew what his him. I woke up... Oh, I mean, I... That is exactly what I mean, Patrick. Well, see you later, buddy. Slugger, that's me. What the? Hi, Sandy. Keep your natural remedies to yourself. Manly dudes like me don't need 'em. I'll have you know that I got this black eye in a fight. Lose? Sandy, I taught the fish who tangled with me a lesson he shan't soon forget. No, I engraved it on his pain gland. Oh, this was no mere man. He was the notorious outlaw Jack M. Crazfish! It all happened late last night... I was walking home from work... alone when all of a sudden, Crazyfish sprang up out of nowhere. He threw a giant tire at the back of my head. Then, he stood over me to gloat. I jumped up and karate kicked his hairpiece right off of its snaps. He was so ashamed he ran all the way home leaving behind a pool of tears. Which I then proceeded to scoop up in my victory tankard and enjoy a nice refreshing beverage. Oh, yeah, that's right. I had miscalculated the trajectory of my cup and the straw jabbed me in the eye, giving me this awful shiner. Ah, phooey. Late schmate. A tough guy like me can show up to work whenever he wants. Adios! Yeah, that's right, pal, do the right thing. Just keep on walking. That's right. Dah-dah-dah-dah, I'm just gonna stop you right there, Squidward. Spare you the oxygen. We all know you weaker folk can't afford to waste it. All right, folks, listen up 'cause I'm only gonna say this once. Tough guys don't like to repeat themselves. I'm talking to you, gramma! Now I suppose all of you are wondering how I got this black eye. All right, who said that?! Was it you, gramma? Well, folks, I don't happen to see it as a shiner so much as a shining trophy of my glorious triumph over the forces of evil. Oh, I know what you're thinking. Who in the name of Neptune would want to tangle with a guy like SpongeBob SquarePants? Well, I'll tell you who. It was a peaceful morning in Bikini Bottom. I emerged from my fruit-shaped bungalow fresh as a bee when a wanted cry of distress pounded against my eardrum. Hey, let's save all the questions until the end! As I was saying... I quickly located the source of the cry which was a victim tied at my feet. "Don't worry, I'll save you." I assured... when a large bowling pin struck me in the face. The hurler was none other than Jack M. Crazyfish. And I could tell by that cold sore on his lip that today he meant business. With cat-like reflexes, I preempted his attack. But the scoundrel had me sabotaged. And I fell face down on a pile of extra large staples. He lunged at me, but I got him in the ribs with my novelty feather duster. Down he fell like a mighty oak. And there he lay. The very thought of being vanquished made Jack M. Crazyfish burst into tears. The force of his crying was so strong, I had to take evasive action. But one of the blasts went haywire and hit me right in the face... ...and that's how I got this black eye and gave Jack M. Crazyfish a whomping of a lifetime. Whoo...football! Oh, kind of tall, handlebar mustache... I kind of thought it was teal, but that sounds like him all right. Wait a second, how did you know he was wearing a green hat? He's... real... Mr. Crazyfish, please don't skin me alive! I made all that stuff up. I was just kidding about whomping you, right folks? You remember. Hi, Gary. All right, look. I had a toothpaste tube, like this. But I couldn't get it open 'cause the cap was stuck. And I guess... I haven't been working my arms out that much lately. And I opened it up like this... Then I was walkin', like this. And I didn't see where the cap went, like this. So, I slipped on it and I landed right on my wrench, like this. And I gave myself a black eye, like this. Uh... like these. So you see? I made it all up so I could keep from looking stupid. Makes sense, doesn't it? One super hot and delicious custom order Krabby Patty with extra sauce, my lord. Served directly to your waiting Head and neck area. Sir, please, I am so sorry. Noooooooo! All in the line of duty, Mr. Krabs. Isn't it great, Squidward? Yeah, but it's so worth it when you get to work in these. Yes, sir. Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, please. And I'm kind of in a hurry. Doot, do, doot-do, doot... Oh, my gosh. You guys live in a dump! But we don't have time for that right now. We gotta get you back to the Krusty Krab for your special appearance. I'll take ya. Wow! I haven't seen you do the Spine Blaster since... ...since episode 647. When you blasted that guy's spine. You still got it. Ladies and gentlemen, I present Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Mermaid Man. I brought you something to refresh your memory. The Chum Bucket?!! Plankton must be behind this. Hold it right there! You forgot your...Krabby Patties! Not so fast! You're not dealing with an ordinary fry cook! It's time for you to meet... Fry Boy, Defender of... Ow! Fry Boy... ...Defender of the Krabby Patty! Yes! You lose, Plankton! Now watch as the Krabby Patties' wholesome flavors work their magic! It doesn't make sense. They should have been cured once the pureness of the Krabby Patties entered their... That's it! Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are elderly. Their poor aging tummies must be having a hard time digesting the food. I know just what to do! And the delicious power of Krabby Patties. Well, then, you guys know where to go! Well, Patrick, I guess... I did. Me too, Patrick, me too! Oh, Patrick, if I had only known how hard not saying goodbye could be... Patrick, That's it! You can come with me to summer camp! Then I'd never have to say goodbye! How about now? ...this stuff is just my carry-on, quarter. The rest of my things are right over there. Oh, and quarter, thanks! Boy, that looked like a boring boat to be on, huh, guys? Guys? I had always preferred to recycle. SpongeBob SquarePants! Funny you should ask... once I had... Yeah. I could use a nap. This camp is very upscale! It was quite an enjoyable soap, but it wasn't until this guy got thirsty and decided to drink the bath water! This is a pretty fun camp game, huh Patrick? It's made it even more fun and challenging by the fact that we're wearing these heavy ankle weights. The other campers just aren't having as much fun as you and me. That's it! We'll show him we can be self-starters! Uh... abomination? Me, sir! It's a play, for our amusement, and inspiration! Cool! All done! Really? Aye, for Jib's men, what forces blow the merry winds of Galilee? ♪--and you--♪ Uh... Hey, guys! What are you doing? You first. Me too! And he's gonna eat us! Survival training camp?! Patrick and I love camping! Hey! We'll have you know that just the other day, Squidward commented at our survival skills! The Other Day Thank you, Squidward! Sshhh! We'll show Sandy we're tough as she is! I guess the road smoothed out. That was a close one Patrick! We were almost left in the wilderness... without Sandy! And nobody would have known where to find us! No, Patrick! No! Sandy, wait! Sandy! Sandy! Well, at least we have food, shelter, and water. I'll pitch the tent while you start a campfire. Then when we're all settled, I'll cook us up some grub. Okay Patrick, we're all set! We have fresh water, a rugged tent for shelter... Say, where did you get the firewood? You burned our food supply?! Oh-no! Quick! Quick! Cover it over something! Hey Patrick, nice job. Whew! Uh-oh, well, we burned our food, ruined our tent, and lost all our water. Patrick, we are going to need to use our razor-sharp quick wits if we're going to make it out of here alive! Okay. Here's the plan... Sure Patrick, what do you think we should do? Uh, Patrick? Sorry, sorry, take your time. No hurry Patrick. Sure. Let's go play in that cave over there. I like it here. It's rooooooomy, and best of all, we have this cave all to ourselves. Huh? Nice. We'll only stay here tonight, and head home tomorrow. What do you mean we'll be here forever? How long have you been here? We'll be here forever? We're doomed! You're right Patrick, but what will we eat, where will we sleep? Patrick's right. If I'm stuck here, I should make the best of it. I'll build myself a new home. There, just like my pineapple in Bikini Bottom...only, smaller, comfy, safe and sound in my own little home. Patrick? Do'h! Patrick is my best friend! He wouldn't hurt me. He's got the taste of flesh! Hey, Patrick. Sounds like you're hungry.  It's all true! Patrick is going to eat me! What should I do? This mud replica of the Krusty Krab should protect me from that fiend Patrick! He's onto me! Must hide! . Ha,ha, I'm safe, Patrick can't get me in here, , I don't need to go outside, I have everything I need right here! Spatula. Now I just need some buns. Oh, crunchy. I can't take it! I need some real food! Yyyess! Yyeess! I shall eat Patrick before he eats meee! I'm gonna cook you up and eat ya! I know what you're doing, you're playing dumb, but it won't work, because I'm going to eat you before you eat me! Oh, no you don't! Where'd he go? Come on out, Patrick. You can't hide forever! What's this? Warm water? Ah, thanks, Patrick! I did get a trifle unhinged, didn't I? Thanks, Patrick! You're a real pal! Funny looking bathbeads. They almost look like carrots. Carrots?! You're making soup out of me! Why don't you take a nap on this nice, soft bed? There, that's it. Here, I'll tuck you in with this nice soft blanket , and what's a little blanket without a little ketchup? Wait! Come back! You're not properly seasoned! No! Gotcha! I got you! Did what? Wow! It's great that we've won our medals, but I'm still hungry. Backing up! Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop... ...boop, boop, boop! Your Krabby Patty, sir. You mean with a smile? Yes, sir! Not the mollusks! There aren't any mollusks coming, are there, Patrick? Wow, Patrick. I didn't know you had a famous relative. Gee, thanks Mr. Krabs! Doesn't that hurt? Gosh, I don't have anyone famous in my family. I'll bet you're someone's famous poop-covered ancestor. I never realized how sad and empty my life was, until my friends pointed it out. Hi, Sandy. Do you have any famous relatives, Sandy? Seems like everybody in town has a famous relative. Everybody except me. Well, there was my uncle Sherm. He could stick an entire watermelon up his nose. Gasp! I've never even heard of him! He got his own statue? So my Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa SpongeBuck saved the town of Bikini Gulch! And everyone in it! I wonder what happened to the statue of my Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa. It was much better than that one we have now. Wait a minute, Look, Sandy! SpongeBuck was here all along! Sorry, Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa. I didn't recognize you all covered in poop. I've got a lot to live up to. Maybe one day people will know the name SpongeBob SquarePants! Breaker, breaker outer perimeter, looks clear. Over. Are you sure you're not trying to say Roger? Patrick, we have visual contact. Now taking evasive action. Subject still in close proximity. Over. Please reply. Please, contact immanent Patrick. Respond now. Please. Please! I can't speak up Patrick, there's a jellyfish here and I'm worried it might sting me if I make any loud... ... noises. Is he still after us, Patrick? Should we turn around and check? Oh, I think I landed on my pain center. Patrick, look! There's a weird thing sticking out of the ground right there. No, not that, Patrick. This! I don't know. I think there's something buried underneath it. And I'm gonna go get some shovels so we can dig it up. Phew! Nothing like a little manual labor to put some hair on your chest, eh, Patrick? Plus look at what we unearthed! A UFO! Go on, you first. Kinda dark, huh? Well, there's gotta be a light switch around here somewhere. Found it. Excuse me, sir. Hey, Patrick, look! We're moving! And here's the steering wheel! Gimme that wheel! Can we park here? Hey, Mr. Krabs! Look what Patrick and I found! We're gonna use it to go on a long journey. Bye, Squidward. Bye, Mr. Krabs. Bye, Squidward. I like Squidward. Hello! Could I interest you in a Krabby Patty? I don't know, Patrick. Mr. Krabs said if we didn't find customers, not to come back. Are you sure you don't want to be out first customer, sir. Wait! We'll pay ya! Thank you, sir, come again! Hey, Patrick. Weren't you supposed to be on kitchen duty? Oh, no. You burnt all the patties. It's hard as a rock. How are we gonna find somebody who would buy these? Folks, have I got a deal for you. Won't Mr. Krabs be so proud of us when he finds out how good we're doing. See any new customers, Patrick? Here, let me see. No, Patrick, that says "Abyss." An abyss is a bottomless... ...chasm! Pat, we're falling! Look, Patrick! We've floated back up, out of the deep, dark, depressing, horrible abyss! Daa! We didn't mean it that way, Mr. Sea Monster, sir! What we really wanna know is... are you hungry? Then try one of our Krabby Patties. No! What is it? No, it's a solid! It's a solid! But not just a sandwich. It's a...Chum-Wich. Anything else before we shove off? We- We don't have desserts. We're back, Mr. Krabs! You wouldn't believe it Mr. Krabs, we had so many new customers! There we were at the bottom of a deep, dark, abyss. And we had to let go of something heavy. But on the bright side, we did manage to bring back 37,000 pounds of these decorative deep sea rocks! Well, according to this T shirt, it says my best friend is right here. Right by my side. Wow, clothing that announces our feelings for each other. Let's get them, Patrick. I believe you can. My best friend and I would like to purchase... Patrick, why are you crying? Oh, what are you... Wait, no, this isn't what it looks like! Patrick, look out, behind you!! We’ve gotta ditch these outfits! They're sending out the wrong signals! We need new outfits to show our best friendiness, Pat. Yeah, just like those guys. Best friend outfits like these really make a statement. Wow! I like that one. Hey, mister, where did you and your friends get your matching outfits? There was a battle of Bikini Bottom? You don't wash your hands, Patrick?! Echhh! That's ok. Thank you, friend. So, anyway, I said... Really? Thank you. Frankly, yes, Patrick, that does bother me. What are you saying? Oh, come on, we can work this out. We'll start a new life, just you, me, and this can of disinfectant spray. Come on in, Patrick. Here, let me take your coat for you. But being clean is so much better. Clean! Clean! Fine, if that's how it is, then I am joining the other side! Ha! Got your nose! Not until you wash your hands! Eww, brain juice! Sorry, Patrick , but a filthy slob like you is no match for a clean-cut fellow like me. Really? Satisfied? You could use a makeover, though. Ugh, look at those feet. Don't worry, I'll take care of it. You, sir, could use some dental hygiene! A little toothpaste, and you'll have teeth like mine. You gotta brush in little circles! You're a stinky, stinky sea star. I think you could use a shot of...this! Oh, booger, schmooger, you don't even have a nose. Booger! Run, Mr. Krabs! Patrick is digging for gold! Careful, Patrick, I got a weapon! A Krabby Patty? What are you gonna do, eat it? No, not patty socks! You better stop that! You stop that right now! Not for long, Mr. Sticky-Shorts! You won't have your filth once I use this on you! Try me! It's too late for that! I'm covered in muck and scum! It'll take weeks for me to get clean. I'll need twenty baths a day! I'll have to disinfect my eyeballs! And dry-clean my uvula! Now that I'm filthy, I can spend all day getting clean. No, Patrick, thank you. Fret not, my friend, for I have learned the truth. It matters not whether one is dirty or clean, for can cleanliness exist without filthiness, and would we know filthiness without cleanliness? We must not re-enact the history that divides us, rather we must embrace that which draws us together. All must be free to choose their own path. Right, friend Patrick? Mm-hmm, he has embraced the truth. And what is that, my son? Come, Patrick, my work here is done. Good morning, Gary! Good morning, Mr. Mailman! Isn't life great, Gary? Oh, what a beautiful day. I have the best friends... The best job... And, of course, the bestest pet. I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Hey, Patrick! How goes it? What's that? Oh, that's the first time someone's called me that. Wait, I know who will enjoy my company. Squidward! Sandy! What a neat robot! Let me explain. You see... I was passing by the tree, and I thought it'd be funny if I gave you a surprise. I guess that means there's only one place left to go. A place where I am wanted, wherever they like it or not! SpongeBob WorkPants reporting for duty, Mr. Krabs. No worries, captain! Oops, well, all in a day's work. Now, back to doing what I do best! No way I can mess this up... Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs, are you okay? I guess that's it, then. If Mr. Krabs is calling me "Idiot Boy", it must be true, I know what must be done! I somehow managed to make everyone mad at me. At least you still like me, right, Gare? I'll miss you too, buddy. There's a year's supply of snail food for you. Goodbye, pineapple. Goodbye, Squidward. Goodbye, Patrick. Goodbye, Sandy. Goodbye, Bikini Bottom. Goodbye, life as I know it. Welcome to Bikini Bottom. Population 538. Minus 1. Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy... Oooh, boy, that's quite a lump! I better not hit my head again. That might cause a concussion. Hello there. What's going on? Are you talking to me? I don't know, is it? All I know is that I hit my head on some rocks! Now I can't seem to remember anything. CheeseHead, huh? Wait a minute, what's this? Yeah, just a bit of a headache, Sand- Hey, I remember this place. I'd really love to stay, but the people of New Kelp City need their mayor. Goodbye, everyone. Order up! Who wants to be a dumb old mayor when you're the best fry cook in town? And how could I ever leave behind my bestest friend? Looks like I'm back in Bikini Bottom forever. Two weeks? I'll never make it. Good morning, Nurse Rechid. Hi, Mabel. Saved the blue one just for you. Don't worry, Mabel. I'll bet your amnesia's gonna wear off in no time. Hiya, Squidward! I've been practicing how to flop on my back. It has been two weeks already? . Don't worry, doc. I promise to stay out of the way. Don't rush it! Sorry, go ahead. Wait! Are you sure that the patient has enough emensmansera? Very well, doctor. Carry on. Hold it! The readings on this brain meter are all wrong! We must postpone the operation! You're right, doctor. Proceed with operation sever. Hold it! Wait! I just want to say sorry for interrupting you before. Yeah? Great Neptune... Handsome. But she spelled it wrong. Squidward, you're not handsome. You're a hunk! Gee, Squidward. People really seem to be noticing how handsome you are now. You might even be more handsome than before. If that's even possible. Well, I'm gonna go clip my toenails Squidward, don't forget to enjoy being handsome. Hmmm... I know just what to do. I can't! It was one thing doing it by accident, but I can't hurt you on purpose. Well, okay... Just remember, Squidward, this is going to hurt me more than it's going to hurt you. Hang on, you're starting to look like your old self again. Nope. Still too handsome. It's still not working. Maybe I'm not doing it hard enough. Eeee! Squidward, you're even more handsome now! And the crowd is in a frenzy. I know, Squidward! I'll think of something! Huh! I just need, I just need... Squidward! Look out for that falling shoe! Squidward... You're back! Oh, Squidward...I love you no matter how many times we smash your face. Mmmm-mmmm. Goulash. Hey, anyone out there! You dropped your goulash! Hello? My pores are whistling in the wind. Hahahahaha! That tickles! Aww. The little critter likes my whistling pores. That tickles! All right, Jelly, out you go. It's been a lot of fun, but I gotta get to work. Quite a wind this morning, eh, Jelly? Whoa! Hey, Sparky, can you tell your friends I can't play right now? Stop it! Whoa! Oh! I'm going to be late! I told you guys, I don't have time to play right now! I have not been tardy one time in my career as a fry cook and I'm not going to start today! I gotta call for some help. My fingers are too big for the buttons. Mr. Krabs! I need you! I am sorry, Mr. Krabs, but these jellyfish don't want me to go to work! They're attracted to my whistley holes. Aye aye, sir. Let's get these patties started right! That gives me an idea. Oh, no. They found me. No! No, no, guys, please! Would you mind coming back after business hours? I'm trying to work here. Whoa! Patrick, I don't have any time. I gotta hide from these jellyfish. Ever since the wind started, a sound blows through my holes that jellyfish seem to love. Hahahaha! At least the wind stopped. I think I lost them. Well, I guess I'll just stay here where it's safe... and quiet... and dark. Don't worry, I'll just stay here for a second. Behind these rocks. These sanitary, lifeless rocks. Hey, buddy. Just thought I'd spruce you up a bit. Wuzzat? Oh, you don't say, well guess what? You're my best friend too. Mmm-hmmm. Come on, let's have some fun. Look buddy, mmmmmmmmm. Dinner's ready. Let's have some tea. Do you want some sugar, buddy? One lump or two? Oh, you can have it all. I feel comfortable around you. Can I confess something? Cause I know you'll understand. I have this... problem. I seem to attract jellyfish! Hahahaha! How do you work that out? Hmmmmm. Yeah, yeah. I'm in a loss, too. Oh, barnacles. I'm gonna be stuck in this cave forever! Of course, buddy. Brilliant idea! Let's see what happens this time. Whoooaaa, here they come! Go get 'em, buddy! Hey, guys. What do you think about my little friend's song? Is there something wrong? Hmm, I crafted one stone SpongeBob that uttered a note in a foul key. But if I were to craft another in a different size, the dimension of the hollow center multiplied by the number of holes may offer another tune, one that could soothe those jellyfish. But which one is the right size?! Eh, I guess I'll just have to make a bunch of them. All right. That oughta do her. WOW. It actually worked... Ah. They're finally leaving me alone. I can go back to work now! Krusty Krab, here I come! How long was I gone?! No! No! No! I know I've said this 90 times already but... ♪I love Krabby Patties I think that they are swell. They are the best, there's no contest, and now I'm going to yell.♪ Whew! ♪I love Krabby Patties! I think they're swell. They're so neat, and quite a treat, and how I love the way they smell...

Sweet treat sweet treat. La la la la la la la la laaaaaaaa!♪ Actually, ma'am, it was the absolute fun and deliciousness of a Krabby Patty. Yeah, that's right. Ms. Gristlepuss, maybe if you were to taste the Krabby Patty for yourself, you too could experience the awesome pleasure. Ooh! Okay. Uh, 4 days. You know, it's too bad. The only way to make Krabby Patties again would be if you opened a place that didn't look like a restaurant and did it secretly. Mr. Krabs, I- Whoa, sorry. I was just wondering- Yeah, but...this my home. Hey, Patrick! Thanks for helping out today! Patrick, that bag is totally empty. If Krabby Patties are illegal now, aren't we breaking the law? But what does that have to do with making Krabby Patties? Nooooooo! Ms. Gristlepuss! Look out! Your shoe's untied! ♪La la la la la la la la laaaaaaaa!♪ Really neat. ♪Treat that's neat!♪ Does that mean you're not sending us to the slammer? Don't forget the spatula!

He can't hold down a job and he ruins everything he touches. I can't take it anymore. Maybe you can straighten him out. Love, Uncle Sherm. Well, you're always welcome here, Stanley! My pineapple is your pineapple. Oh well, now I don't have to clean it out. Stanley! You okay in there Stanley? Well, it was bath night. Why not? Oh, that's okay. There's nothing good on TV anyway. Nothing... I don't just work there! I'm vice assistant general manager in charge of certain things. That's me turning the front door key! That's me serving a customer! And that's me performing sanitary maintenance! Oh, that. That's me making Krabby Patties! The best job in the world. It's my calling. Oh, Stanley. You just haven't found your purpose in life, that's all! I know so. I bet my friend Squidward can help you! Hi, Squidward. I'd like you to meet my cousin, Stanley. Oh, it's okay. I'm sure my friend Sandy can think of something. She's a scientist! This is my cousin, Stanley SquarePants. I thought you could teach him how to be a scientist. Err... Maybe you're not scientist material. But don't you worry. I bet Patrick can help you! He's a genius! And so, Mr. Star, that's why we came to you. That's perfect! Patrick can do nothing better than anyone! You'll be learning from the master! See? Isn't he amazing? Don't worry! We just have to keep on looking! Oh, gentle hat, symbol of employment! Cornerstone of my eternal happiness! I don thee now, in preparation, for this workday. Wooo! You have no idea how this feels. Hey, what's wrong, Stanley? You're not still upset about that whole never accomplished anything in your life thing, are you? Good, then why don't you come with me to work. Maybe seeing me totally fulfilled with cheer you up. Yes, sir! Um... Uh... Yes, sir. Your job is to take people's money, and put it in here! I... guess I am, Mr. Krabs. Well, Stanley. Thanks to you, I'm on probation. If you wanna keep this job, you're gonna have to... Woo! Customer at the port bow! Man your stations! Man your stations! Ready for duty! I said I'm ready, Stanley. Whoa! Um...sir? About my cousin, Stanley? About what I said... No. Stanley, I cannot keep covering for you! No! Not my spatula! My spatula... The thing I hold nearest and dearest to my heart... No! No! No! I didn't break my spatula. He did! And I also didn't burn your money. He did that, too! I have been covering for him because he can't do anything right! Good luck on your new job, cousin Stanley! Umm... What day is it? But, Squidward, if I do that, then how am I going to help you get your house ready for the big TV show? I was spying on you. Mucho comprendo, Señor Habanero! Well, that's good, because I lent my brain to Patrick for the weekend. No, not really... He traded me these two chocolate bars for it. Okay. Well, it all looked kinda faded. You got it, Squiddy. Where are we moving her to? Okay. ‘Cause you keep saying “ow”! Wow, Squidward, you're so strong! And you split your sofa in half! It'll be really easy to move now. Roger! Okay, Squidward, found the vacuum! Squidward? Well, I'll just vacuum for him.Hmm, Squidward's house is really messy. I'm going to need some extra power. Don't worry, Squidward! I'll turn it off. Thank you, Patrick! Oh, don't worry, Squilliam, I might be able to get Squidward to help redecorate your house. He is a personal friend of mine. You know success hasn't gone to his head? He is still the same old great guy, he has not changed. ♪Oh I wish I was grinding up the Krabby Patties. That's what I really love to do. Take a couple Boo-Ooh-Ooh! And a pinch of Awoogah!

Not when you got an awesome guitar like that! And only a true rocker would have hair as greasy and nasty as yours. It'll be so cool! We could write songs together! Yay! Come on, let's go get our band together! Patrick, Patrick! Patrick, I've got big news! What's your news? Ew, really? Plankton just asked me to join his Rock-N-Roll band! Can Patrick join our band? Hear that, Patrick? You're in. Wow, Patrick, we're gonna be famous! Oh, Squidward… Would you help us by joining our band? Isn't this great, Plankton? Squidward is gonna help us! You know, Patrick, being in a band gives you the liberty to dress with a little more… Uh, how should I put this? Well, with just a little more… You know, Pizzazz! Whoa-ho-ho, I stand corrected! Man, how'd you grow that so fast? Whoo, yeah! Dig that fancy follicle work! Oh, man, Squidward's not gonna want to miss this. Squidward, aren't you coming to band practice?

So, we have to go in after hours when nobody's there. Why? Mm, that's tough. Don't worry, I'll hide you. We're on our way to our first gig. We're in a band. Got a, uh, what? Yes? Sure thing, officer. They're gone. Don't worry, I just need to get the key out. Whoo, let's rock! All right! Squidward, are you ready? Okay! Patrick, are you ready? Plankton, are you ready? Plankton? PLANKTON! Wait a minute… Was this band just a front so you could steal the Krabby Patty Secret Formula? There's no time to waste, Plankton. We've only got 22 years to practice before our next gig. A one and a two… Barnacles! Just as we were getting to the nitty-gritty! Wow, the Boating Museum! Maybe tomorrow if I can impress Mrs. Puff with an extensive knowledge of boating history, she'll give me a boating license on the spot! See you tomorrow, Mrs. P.! Let's see. Ah, there she is. Whoa! What is this, Gary? Why, it's the complete history of all boating ever and I'm going to memorize it tonight for the big field trip tomorrow. I'm perfectly capable of reading 7,400 pages and still getting my required eight hours of sleep before the bus picks me up at promptly at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow. Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to get started. All right, let's see what this little pamphlet is all about. "Chapter 1: In the beginning, Neptune created the sail." "...but such tragedies will be avoided with the flying boat of the future. The end." Time for a little shuteye before... Oh, Mrs. Puff, can't this wait till tomorrow? Hang on a minute, it is tomorrow! Hey, wait! Hey! Mrs. Puff! Please stop the bus! Wait! No worries, I made it. I assure you, I am well rested and ready to learn. Who knows, Mrs. Puff? Before the day is out you may have learned something yourself. Hey, Mrs. Puff? I made this for you. This, the H.M.S. Pinafore, at 1 to 8,427 scale of course. Mrs. Puff? Do you know how many rowers it takes to propel a trireme? Do you know which boat is fastest on record? Did you know in the future that all boats will be powered by dolphin manure? Did you know that the H.M.S. Bluetoes was originally a racing boat before it became the royal family's private yacht? Do you know what scuttling is? What's bigger, a flotilla or a fleet? Did you know... Ever been on a... Actually, it gets taken to port once a year for maintenance. No problemo, Mrs. P. } I'd say this baby can hold up to... ten clam fishers. Why, I bet they reel in up to 50 clams a day. With two direct-action steam turbines producing 6,500 horsepower geared up to triple screws, it'll get your spices where they need to go. It's working! She's noticing my vast of knowledge! I can now taste the sweet, sweet lamination of a fresh boating license. ...named after the captain's strict diet of scallions, of which the crew complained and the captain's odor strongly resembled. For four years this brigantine explored distant lands discovering places unknown to anyone besides the people who already lived there. You ready to give me that license yet, Mrs. Puff? I knew it! Oh boy, here it is! The main controls! Just look at all this stuff! There's the triple oscillator, and there's the hoist pulley, and there's the booby trap, and there's the long range mast knob, and there's a hot dog with extra mustard. And there is the starter mechanism. That, right there. A/C, hmmm...That's short for "automatic conditionata", and that's fancy fancy talk for "Let's get this party started. Like, instantly!" Whew. Man, I'm glad that's over. Oh, that's a nice touch, what a soothing projection screen. Yes, ma’am. Okay. Innocent lives?! The only one...that can...save...them?! Stop! I know what to do. I read a book. Chapter 1, batten down the hatches. Next, lower anchor. Oh no! The anchor is stuck. I’m going to free it manually. I'll be right back. Done and done. Thirdly, utter a hearty seaman's laugh. And finally, the coup de grace. The only way to park the largest ship ever built, is to perform the Reverse 7/20 Tail Spin. You're right, it hasn't.

It's a code blue situation! Sure thing, Mr. K. Mr. Krabs, you gotta get out here! It's a code blue situation! I think Plankton wants to destroy our way of life. Wow, looks like Plankton finally has some customers! Whoo! Yay! Whoo! Isn't this a boat load of fun, Squidward? I can't wait to see the poor sucker who has to go against that beast! Yes! Patrick? How could they? This is horrible! I can't sit here and watch this! That's my best friend out there! Patrick! No time for chit chat, get in! Hurry up, Nelly! What do we do now, Patrick? NO! Patrick, now is not the time for eating, now is the time to avoid being eaten by that giant... Huh? That's it, Patrick! He's not chasing us, he's chasing those tasty, tender, delicious, succulent sausages around your neck. My pleasure captain! Sounds like Squidward ate at Mario's last night. Good thing no one's around to notice his embarrassing... Those construction workers! Squidward will die of embarrassment if they hear his dilemma! Poor Squidward, he must be in too much pain to make courtesy noises. I'll cover for him! Whoa! Sorry, fellas, this sure is a noisy trowel. Look at this thing! Ah, I really should get... You mean that wasn't gastrointestinal distress? You've really made him happy. Okay... Don't worry, Squidward, we'll do it together! Are you sure you don't want any help, Squidward? Yes, Patrick? Broke your bottom, oh, Patrick, you're a card! Whoa! Hey, Patrick, I think you should see a doctor. What job is that? The doctor will see you now, Mr. Star. Mmm hmm. Mmm hmm. Mmm hmm. Oh no! No, no, no, no, no! My patient is very sick! Wow, Squidward, they really liked you! Just don't get a "swelled head". La, la, la... La-la-la, la, la-la-la... I'm not trying to do anything. I'm just having a decent morning. Oh, Squidward, a banshee screams like this: Ahhhhhhh... Really? I'm not normal? Squidward? How does one become normal? What's wrong with me? I need to understand normal! "How to be Normal." Hm, this video should help. Yes, yes, and yes. Normaaaality. Craters and freckles? Yeah... Hi, how are ya. I took your advice. From now on, I'm normal. Yup. Yup. Wonderful weather we're having. Okay, see ya 'round. Yes, sir. I'll do it... normally. Hi, how are ya. Hi, how are ya. Wonderful weather we're having. Okay, see ya 'round. You know, it's a funny thing, Squidward. I smoothed out the edges of my personality and the rest just followed suit. Now I am utterly normal. Maybe this thing is out of ink. What you call dull I call normal. I guess the decision to be normal was more life changing than I thought. Hi, how are ya. Oh, I got normal. Let's do something normal, like window shopping. I think I'll pass. But I do need to defragment my hard drive, would you like to help? Okay, see ya 'round. Hi, how are ya. Thank you. Tell me, what are you doing cooped up in here when the weather outside is so normal. Wow, that's something you don't see in the average house. And you know what else is abnormal? Your nose—it's all bulbous and flappy. Your eyes are a little odd, too. Looks like your whole face could use some work. Yeah, there we go. See? Looking normal already. One more thing, Squidward. You don't wear pants. Oh, what happened? I lost my job and my best friend and now I'm too normal for Squidward. Maybe I have taken this normal thing too far. No problem, SpongeBob. You made yourself normal. Now all you have to do is reweird yourself. All it'll take is a mental adjustment and some tight clenching. Now focus... and clench. Oh, well, if I'm going to get weird, I'm going to need to see a professional. That's very nice, Patrick, but I need you to retrain me. I want to be abnormal again. Please, Patrick. If anyone can teach me the arcane art of the weird, it's you. Teach me how to be me, again. Oh, thank you, Patrick! Patrick, I'm feeling very self-conscious right now. Tap erus uoy era? Huh? I don't know. I guess I became permanently normal. I don't wanna be normal. Normal is not worth it. Wow, I guess Squidward's normal looks scared me back to my original form. Thanks, buddy, you saved my life. It sure is, buddy. It sure is. Gary, come and get it! Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary must have gotten an early start. Rise and shine, Squidward! You don't wanna be late again. Okay, see you at the Krusty Krab. I guess Squidward needs his beauty sleep. Not everyone is blessed with my natural good looks. Patrick, it's morning! You don't want to forget to wake up again. Patrick? Okay, see you after work, sleepy head. Slow day. Good night, Squidward. Good night, Mr. Krabs. Gary, I'm home! Gary? You here, buddy? Gary? He hasn't touched his food! Squidward! Open up! Squidward, have you seen Gary? He's gone missing! Squidward? Not a sign of Squidward anywhere. Squidward? You up here? Hmm, Squidward's clarinet. It's not even warm. Squidward's missing, too! Patrick, open up! Squidward and Gary are missing! Patrick's gone, too. What if everybody's gone?! Mr. Krabs! He's gone, too! Sandy! She's gone. Where did everybody go?! Go! Go! Go! Everybody's gone! But I swear that I will keep the memory of Bikini Bottom alive, by living out their lives for them. SpongeBob, will you be quiet? You're disrupting my genius. Mr. Krabs, sir, can I have a raise? ""No! Now get to work! Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs, sir! Excuse me, sonny, may I have a Krabby Patty Deluxe please? Right away, sir! I mean... whatever. Hey, SpongeBob, we got an order for a Krabby Patty Deluxe. Heaven knows why. Coming up, Squidward! Excuse me, Sandy, but may I have some more of this delicious iced tea? Why sure! Whoops, just a sec. Why sure now, SpongeBob. Good morning, class. Can anyone tell me the first thing you do when riding a boat? Ahem, floor it? That's right, you floor it. Excellent work, SpongeBob! Why thank you, Mrs.... Pu... Pu... Puff! This is pointless! I'm not Mrs. Puff! I can't replace everyone! I'll never be happy again! Ooh, my driver's license! That's the baby. Hi, fella, it's me. It's okay, I'm licensed. Oh yeah, listen to that purr! La-la-la- -la-la-la... Good night, Boaty. No! No! No! Oh, Gary, I had a nightmare that all my friends were gone! And I was driving a-! So it was true! I... guess it's just you and me now, Boaty. This is where I work. Do you want to help me cook up some Krabby Patties? Great! Back when everyone was around, they used to enjoy these. Here, try one. What? You don't like Krabby Patties? Huh! Well, I guess we can still make this work. Whew. Boy, we learned a lot about each other today. You know? I thought I'd go crazy without all my friends and acquaintances around, but it looks like you were all I needed to stay sane! What? A puppet of my old best friend? Made entirely out of Krabby Patty Meat? Oh, Boaty, you are a card. Sorry I'm late, Patrick. Boaty was telling me a joke. Who, Boaty? Oh no. He's... Really? Wait, Patrick! Don't go! Huh? Nothing! Boaty! I... I'm just going to bed. Dear diary, not sure if I can trust any vehicle. Run for it as soon as the coast is clear. Huh? You're all still alive? Well, where did you go? National No SpongeBob Day? A day? But you guys have been gone for weeks. You too, Patrick? I'm... glad you had fun. Really? Wow. A whole day dedicated to me. 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, whoa! Open for business! Oh, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, can I do it today? Huh? Can I? Can I do it? Freshness, check. Buns, check. Fresh patties. Check. Oh, silly me, I'm forgetting one more minor detail. Oh, yeah. Is it getting hot in here? Or is it just you? Ah! "Two Krabby Patties. P.S., SpongeBob, you're an idiot. Love, Squidward." Aw, love you, too, Squiddy. Two Krabby Patties, coming right up! Whoa! Hmm. Whew, this thing is stuck pretty good. Whoa! I guess this is it. Oh, you really saved me! Whoa! Hey, a splinter. Okay, well, it's been nice knowing you but you have got to go. Now. Okay, out we go. Oh, that kinda' hurts. Come on. Ooh, that really hurts. Oh, barnacles, this hurts! Conch-shelled manatees, this is painful! Okay, you're tough, you're smart, and you're charming, but you are still no match for me! Look! A bald eagle with a mustache! Okay, fine, stay. But I hope you like making Krabby Patties. Ow. Ow. Ow. You're making this a little bit difficult. Luckily, I am ambidextrous! Perfection! Okay, good, 'cause these two Krabby Patties are ready! Yes? Yes. What's what? Know what? What? What thing where? This! Well, you see, this got stuck up there so I stacked stuff and I climbed up to reach it. I reached the grip and I got it but then I fell and I screamed! I was sure I was dead, but then I wasn't, but then I tripped and I got this splinter... Squidward? Squidward, were you listening at all? I got this really bad splinter, you see? And I couldn't hold the spatula with my hand so I used my nose. Makes sense now, huh? Good one, Squiddy. Yeah. I know, it hurts so bad. Finds out what? You mean my splinter? H-h-h-h-home? But I'm fine! Why? Hey, wait, I'm fine! While it lasted? What are you doing? W... What are you...? But, but, but, Squidward, I'm fine! I'm fine! I'm okay! Look at me, nothing's wrong! See? See? See? See? No, anything but that. Please, Squidward, you can't let this happen! You can't let them force me away! Please, Squidward! Don't tell Mr. Krabs! Wew.  He does? You're right, Squidward. I need help! Please pick up, please pick up, please pick up. Patrick? Thank goodness you're there. I got a splinter on my thumb and... Thanks, Patrick. Uh, Patrick... Patrick? Patrick, this isn't helping! I'm not! Patrick, you didn't go to med school. Patrick, I'm sorry. I really need your help. Please, Patrick! I don't want to go home early! Phew, thanks, Patrick, you're a lifesaver. Ow! Ah. What's what? You mean this? Heh, company pride, of course. Yes? Yes. What's worker's compensation? What is the meaning of this?! We're slide whistling! Squidward, slide whistling is more than just simply tooting on an instrument! It's a way of life! Let's show him Patrick. You see, Squidward! Slide whistling can add a little zest to the humdrum of everyday life. True, Squidward, true. We have had our fun. But you know what's twice as much fun?! Twice as many slide whistles! After you, my good man. Look Patrick! Squidward is finally playing along. Alright! Wow, Squidward! You have got quite an ear for music! Yes my friend. You got... the goods! Come, play some more maestro. Me and Patrick want to sing to your saweeet tunes! Oh! We insist! Patrick, are you thinking what I'm thinking? Patrick, do you think Squidward is taking this a little too far? Squidward, are you sure you don't wanna stop? Up ahead! Doctor, why did you leave the whistle in his throat? Wow Squidward, listen to you! You're getting better already! Here we'll help. This is how to live, isn't it, my friend? What's that, Pat? I'm living like Larry! Whoo-hoo! Hey, Patrick, where you going? I don't know about this, Patrick. De dee do dee do livin' like Larry. Dee dee dee doo livin' like Larry. Deedeedeedee livin' like Larry. Uh, Patrick, where are we going? I don't know, Patrick, this looks very danger... Well, wait a minute, Patrick, I think your missing the point. "Living like Larry" doesn't mean throwing caution to the wind, and risking everything on a stunt that will cost you your life. No, Patrick, I mean your life. I'm not going. Mmm-hmm. I wonder how Patrick's doing with his "living like Larry" thing. Oh, it's okay, buddy, I think you learned your lesson. Hmm? Now, you just let me handle those guys out there. Gentlemen, Gentlemen. I know that you might be angry at my friend for his shenanigans, but you are not the only victim. His reckless thrill chasing has made him a hollow shell of his former self. Just look So let me assure you, his days of "living in the moment" are over. Can you not forgive him for what ever he did? By the way, what did he do that made you all so cranky? So scared! Adrenalin pumping! Spine tingling! Endorphins rushing! I've never felt so alive! Oh, yeah, baby, yeah! This is what Patrick was talking about! This is really living in the moment! Woo-yeah! This is life! Woo, woo, yeah, woo! Now I am finally living like Larry! Oh, come on, Patrick, what happened to being in the moment? Yeah, yeah, you said it, buddy! Now we're really living like Larry! Prepare for countdown! 3-2-1 Lift off. Whooooo! Whoohooooo! Whoowoowoo! What are you two lazy bones doing lying around? There's a really cool ramp down the hall, I've got room for two more. What would Larry do? I thought you left your swim suit at home. Rotten eggs? Who's Craig Mammalton? Wow, Patrick, an invitation to our first summer shindig! And here it is! It seems to be stuck. Must be this tan to enter. Why, thank you. In fact, it's time for another coat. There, now that we've turned your rock into a tanning bed, we're sure to get tan enough for the party! Let's just test it out first to be sure. Ooh, Patrick, how do you feel? My turn! Remember Patrick, 15 seconds exactly. No, no, Patrick, 15 seconds exactly! It's really important... It's working. Okay Patrick, I'm done. Patrick? Patrick, you there? Patrick? Uh, Patrick, it's time for me to get out. Well, Patrick, how do I look? What, what, what do you mean? I must have been under the tanning machine too long. I'll ask Squidward, he's always so helpful. He'll know what to do. Hi Squidward. Oh, I'm not a ghost, Squidward. I used Patrick's tanning booth, and I stayed under too long. Huh, now I'll never get into that party. I look... AMAZING. Time to go to the party! Oh what a cute "wittle" baby. Cootchie-cootchie-coo. Oh, yeah, that hit the spot. Oh, I think you'll have to go to the party without me, Patrick. There's just no way I can get that golden brown in time. But that's no reason you shouldn't go. Patrick, why did you... No, really Patrick, what are you... Uh, I fell sticky. Wooh! Thanks, Patrick. Uh, I'm stuck. Oh, no! Caramel, hardening! Gotta get out of here. Patrick? Patrick? Can I get a little help here? No, Patrick I... Hey, Patrick. Do you think that maybe too much sun is a bad thing? And SpongeBob! Patrick is helping me to do good deeds today, like trimming your kelp garden. Wow, I wish I had a bottle of that kelp grow stuff. Thank you Patrick. You know my shoes feel kinda tight. Huh, nice and roomy. That's a great idea Squidward! Oh yes, I agree completely. Come on Patrick, let's do some good deeding! Hey Gary, that shell of yours looks a little cramped. There, now you have plenty of space. There he is. Now, Patrick! There you go Mr. Krabs. You always wanted to make "big money." Good deed accomplished! I ask for no reward. I know, and it is a burden I must carry. But times a wasting! We need another good deed! Um, right, that thing that we did that day. Are you sure? Hmm, how to fix his nose? Patrick, that's brilliant! That didn't work. I think I'll just even him out. First, a bigger head. Right, too small. And a giant. That's easy, play giant lumbering monster tag! And we run around and scream like crazy! Try and catch us, giant monster Squidward. This is really fun. You are very good at pretending Squidward. Look how you're all sweaty and angry, and you got the whole town to play along. Oh, goodness gracious, yes. Squidward is the nicest giant of them all. Even though you really wanted to. Good night, Squidward. Patrick and I are having a sleepover, in your belly button. Oh Patrick, this is terrible! Squidward did not like the kindness we did him. We shall do him another. We did it! Since our last kindness didn't go so well, we brought you a new one. We used your kelp to make a kelp-mâché clarinet. What about Patrick, does he have to find his own flowers too? Patrick, that's not a nose that's a... ...hermit crab. It's not so ab-normal to be noseless. Just look around. Lots of fish don't have noses. Well Patrick, if you're so concerned about not having a nose, why don't you just get a new one stitched on to your face. All right Patrick, let's unveal the new shanauze! There it is, Patrick! Your brand new sniffer! Looking good buddy! Well, I've gotta go to work now. Have fun with your new nose. Hiya Patrick. How... Whoa! Hey, looking good. 1, 2, 3, 4 Come on SquarePants, be a man! Patrick, help! I can't work at the Krusty Krab looking like this. I'm out of uniform. Come on SpongeBob, be a man! Mr. Krabs? It is not Patrick's fault! It's the new nose that has betrayed us. My grandma SquarePants always says, punish the nose, not the man. But we're going to need something foul, something beyond foul, a stench that will blow the socks off his fungus-infested socks! Okay, this should be stinky enough. I've gathered every sweaty sock, moldy pizza, and rotten piece of fruit in Bikini Bottom. With a little raw sewage for good measure. Yes sir! Here lies the nose of Patrick Star. Rip. Well this is terrible! All Patrick wanted was to be like the rest of us, and we punished him for it! You wanted to see me, sir? Mr. Krabs, there aren't any chairs. Ooh, yes, sir. And they've been the best years of my life, sir. No! Could you repeat that? I won't let you down. Yes? Uh, SpongeBob. Yes, sir! And now, let's get you into the Krabby Patties, secret ingredienty. Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? No! What's going to happen to the Krabby Patty secret recipe? What's this? A hole? How did that happen? An incision. Almost as if someone, or something did this on purpose. That's it! A thief must have cut a hole, and swiped the secret ingredient! But who? Right away, sir. Mr. Krabs trusted me, and I let him down! Hi, Patrick. Maybe you can help me. With this. Not that kind of help. This used to have the Krabby Patty secret ingredient inside. But now, it's missing! Someone stole it, Patrick! And we need to find out who! You and I are going to need to do a little detective work! Aha! I knew it was you! Oh, come on, Plankton, don't play dumb. You know you stole the secret Krabby Patty ingredient! Why don't you tell me. Is it?! All right, no more jokes! Either you tell me where the secret ingredient is, or we'll be forced to use other means of making you talk! Then how do you explain this? And so the truth floweth forth. Mm-hmm. Yuck. Well, he's clean. But if Plankton didn't steal the ingredient, who did? Only someone who specializes in science, could reverse engineer the recipe, based on the secret ingredient. Hmm, a scientist. There she is. You hang back. I'm going in for a closer look. Oh, my gosh! It is Sandy! Enjoying them Krabby Patties lady? Oh long enough, "buddy." I'm onto you, squirrel. You thought no one could figure it out, but I pieced it together. I know exactly how you got all those patties. What I am getting at, is that you... ...cloaked yourself an invisibility potion, snuck through the security perimeter... ...then used a time-freezing device to freeze time, used a laser beam to cut open the case, stole the Krabby Patty secret ingredient, reverse engineered it, and made your own patties. So you wouldn't have to pay. 283 Krabby Patties. That's right, I cooked this order. I guess this means you didn't use a laser beam, or invisibility. My own house, huh? Why'd you do it, Gary?! You've told us that story 100 times now, Gary. Unfortunately, my partner and I don't want to hear stories, we want to hear the truth! Look, we know you stole the secret ingredient and it's obvious how you did it! First, you hitched a ride on a security chopper, then jumped into the drop zone. Then, when I stopped to pull up my sock, you snuck up behind me, and did what any snail could do. You shot corrosive acid from your tearducts, which melted the case, allowing you to steal the secret ingredient. Yeah, you're right, Gary, that is impossible. I never would have stopped to pull up my sock during a pickup. What's that, Gary? You did see someone leaving the Krusty Krab with a mysterious black case that night? Mr. Snail, could you please describe this, this marauder to the sketch artist. Open up in there, Tentacles! We know you're in there! We just want to ask you a few... Not cooperating. Gotcha! You thought you could hide your crimes. Well, I'm glad you asked, because this is about you stealing the Krabby Patty secret ingredient! And we have an eye witness who saw you leaving the scene of the crime, with a mysterious black case. Yes! Because you can't make Krabby Patties without... tap dancing shoes? I guess this means you didn't steal the secret ingredient. Mr. Krabs, I don't know how, sir, but somebody stole the Krabby Patty secret ingredient! I know, Mr. Krabs. It just slipped away from me somehow. All I know is that it had to be someone who knew about the delivery, and was at the Krusty Krab during the delivery, and this person would have to know what to do with the secret ingredient when he got it. Me?! Mr. Krabs, isn't that the stolen secret ingredient? Step right up, and get your free Krabby Patties! Yes, sir! Oh, you can count on me sir. Pardon me, you smart fellow. Down here. Why settle for Plankton's lumpy Chum, when you can enjoy a steaming Krabby Patty for free? Barnacles! There he is. Just in time for breakfast. Oh, I am such a clumsy oath. I sure hope nothing happens to this Krabby Patty while I step carefully over this rock here. Oh, no! Too late! No! No! Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Come on, Nat. Just one accidental bite! I see you're not hungry right now, but I'm telling you, that Krabby Patty is gonna make a great snack later. Oh, fishpaste! Yeah, yeah, yeah, keep your tiny pants on Plankton, bleep bloop. There's your Chum, bleep blap blop. Why, don't be ridiculous, my husband, bleep blap. Of course it's me. So you're saying that you love Chum? And all that you ever eat is Chum? Interesting. I guess you'll have to make Chum that's as good as Plankton's. Triple irony, Plankton! Though you nabbed Krabs trying to steal your formula, I'm still here to foil your evil plans! So, it's like a dollop of irony on top of an ironic twist. I mean just think about that. You know, in a weird way, it's like we never left the... Quickly, now is the time to be a hasty retreat! 97, 98, 99, 100. Okay, Gary, let's do the other side now. Gary, can you hear that? Oh Squidward, it's you. I thought I heard something. Breathing. Okay! I have it, Squidward, you gave it to me to leave you alone yesterday. Squidward, you can have the $5 back. Mr. Krabs says-- Coffee rain! Chocolate rain! Squidward! Squidward, wait! Squidward! Squidward! Squidward! Squidward! Squidward? You left your keys on the table back there. Hey, Squidward? Didn't you used to have one of those cucumber bicycles? Why? Okay, I'll see you later then, Squidward. Oh, Squidward! Psst, Squidward, sit here. Here. Don't worry Squidward, we're boating buddies now! I'll teach you everything I know, and then we can. Oh, I understand. I understand perfectly, boating buddy. Oh, I am here because I. Well, first, I started over here. And then I went way over here. Do-do-do-do, like that. Then, I went around like this, and over here like that, and across this lane, and down here like this, and then and then I went around, and stopped right here. Do you like it Squidward? Ah, lunch time, eh boating buddy? Squidward, do you have any mustard in there? Uh, step on the gas? I got it, I got it. Hey, where'd Squidward go? Pst, hey, boating buddy, if you need any help, I've taken this test hundreds of times, and- Okay Squidward, if that's the way you want it. You said you didn't need my help, Squidward, and that you didn't need me. Before what? Yay! Don't worry Squidward, I've never gotten one answer right on this test. But we'll meet again next week, at Mrs. Puff's boating school! Order up! Like two more satisfied regulars, Mr. K. Oooh, let me see there was... none. What a fantabulastical day! Eh, Squiddy? Oh! My very own press badge! On the thirst for a juicy story, eh? Hmm, but what kind of story is juicy enough to quench their dry news gullets? I don't even know where to begin to look. No news to report here. Stop the presses, it's Patrick! And he appears to be waiting for the bus! This is the kind of breaking story my readers are waiting for! Patrick Star, I'm scoop SquarePants from the Krabby Kronicle. Everyone's wondering, what bus are you taking today? Whoa, this story is juicy! Meaning of what, Mr. Krabs? Imagination! Mr. Krabs, isn't that lying? Mrs. Puff is going to laugh her hat off when she reads this! Yeah, but that isn't the story I wrote. Let's see what there is to see. Wait a minute. Larry the Lobster. Hmm, wonder what kind of dirt he has under those muscles. Uh-huh, this looks shady, very shady. Very interesting... Hello, Larry. Ruined? What are you talking about? Mr. Krabs, can I have a word with you? That's exactly what I wanted to talk to you about, sir. I don't think these stories are doing anyone any good. Yeah, but isn't there a way we could write juicy stories without hurting people? Yeah, I... I know. Yes, Mr. Krabs, you could say that. Mr. Krabs, we're hurting people! Mr. Krabs, you wouldn't! Aye-aye, sir. Mr. Krabs, I can't write these stories anymore. I've seen people's lives ruined, with my own eyes! Gee, Mr. Krabs, I've written about everybody in town. Any ideas, sir? Oh, the wildest story ever, huh? Ahh-ahh, it's a surprise. Mr. Krabs, are you okay? You wanna stay here? At my house? With me? Yee-hee! Slumber party! We can stay up really, really late! And tell ghost stories! And trade socks! No. They invite boys over and destroy the house! You know how girls are. Do I know any... no. But Gary does. But, Mr. Krabs, it’s only a mov-ieeeeeeeeee......... I don’t think this is the scary part yet. Gosh, Mr. Krabs. I never knew you were scared of zombies. Zombie teenagers? Mr. Krabs... Oh, I do, Mr. Krabs. It must be horrible to invite people into your home and have them treat your property with so little respect! Gosh, no, Mr. Krabs. Leave it to me, Mr. K. I’ve got the perfect disguise. I don’t know, but she is ug-ly! Now to put on that disguise I told you about. Ta-daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrgh! Huh? Huh? Huh? Pizza delivery. Y-You didn’t? Your dad sent it. It’s already paid for. Um.. uh... Hey! They’re on to us, Mr. Krabs! Drive! I wanted to come with you, Mr. Krabs.  Oh, Mr. Krabs, that’s my eye! Piano repair man! Mr. Krabs, it’s working! Maybe we should leave them alone, Mr. Krabs. They seem pretty trustworthy. Yes, Mr. Krabs. It’s me, SpongeBob SquarePants. Can we talk, Pearl? Whale to sponge? Oh, please let me stay at your party! Oh, please, oh, please, oh, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please! Give me one good reason why I can’t stay! Yeesh, I only asked for one. Really?! So if I prove I’m fun, can I stay? I only need eight! Whoo! Party! Crank it up! These old newspapers are confetti in fun hands! Whoo! Ooh, Mr. Krabs' root beer cellar. Party! Fun! Who wants to dance? Let’s boogie! Whoo! Well, Mr. Krabs, you know how boys are. Ow! Mr. Krabs, I think I know what’ll cheer you up. A mug of ice cold root beer! Bikini Bottom pet show today! Good thing I put those notes there. Otherwise, I could've forgotten. And I wouldn't wanna do that because the Bikini Bottom pet show is where you gotta go to see the best pets in town. Not that any other pet can take a chance against my buddy Gary. He's the bestest pet in the whole world. Love you, Gare-Gare. Oh! The show starts in an hour! Hey, Gare, time to... Gary? Ow! Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary? Oh, hi ya, Squidward. Whoooooooaaaaaa! Ohhhhhhhh! Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary, there you are. What are you doing here? Well, today is the day you show everyone else you're the best pet in the whole world. Now, for a quick checklist. Let's see, eye reflects. Check. Slime viscosity. Hi, Squidward. Ready! Hi again, Squidward. Check. And last, but not least, a quick undercarriage check. Whoa, okay, maybe we should skip that one. Let's see... Yep, that's about does it. A second, buddy. I'll carry your shell. Huh, people sure seem to treat their pets differently here. Luxurious mane? I always use an old rope. I guess that's not good enough. Uh, Gary? Pedicure? I didn't realize how much went into this. Oh, don't be so protective of me, Gary. I know I've been an horrible parent. But no longer! From this moment on forth, I vow to give my Gary the utmost in empty frivolity! To live by the standards of snail grooming, set forth by: that guy! No, not you. Enough dilly-dallying! We got to get down to business! Hold still, Gary. Uhhhhhh! Come on, buddy! Uhh! Uhh! There. Oh, you're like a little cuddly present. And the piece de resistance: glow-in-the-dark paint. Hey, where are you going? Gary, wait. We got to go back to the pet show! Because we have got to show those other pets we are just as fancy as they are. Oh, come on, Gary. Don't be this way. I'm doing it for you, not me. That's what I like to hear because I can bring this out. Your very own studded collar. With two rows of diamonds. Here, try it on. Now, let's get back out there and knock them out of their shells. Patrick, I'm so glad you just happened to show up. Help me. Gary, stop it! I'm only doing this because I love you. Gary, look, it's him. Hello! Sorry to bother you. Just wanted to get your opinion on my snail, Gary. This is it, Gary. This is our time to shine! Wow, Patrick. There's a whole lot of pet loving going on here today. Patrick, I'm right here. Don't worry, Gary. He'll be back in time to see us win first place. Now, let's go scope out the competition. Hmm... Maybe you needs some shades, eh, Gare? Silly boy, you're not supposed to eat the leash. Come on, buddy. Boy, these pets are gussied today. Maybe I need a top hat or something to class it up a bit. Gary? Oh, thanks for reminding me. I didn't know your collar was loose. Now, let's go get that top hat, buddy. Uhhhhhhhhhh! There you go. It's in the bag! Gary, no! Gary, you spit him out right now! I'm sorry. He usually only bites me. I speak a little bit, sir. I know what they're saying. They're saying: Owners, owners, owners, owners, owners, owners, owners. Please, please, please, please please, please, please don't be this way. They're saying they don't want this type of pampering. They want to be treated as companions, not dress-up dolls. They don't want scratchy outfits, they want to be scratched! They are protesting the indignity of wigs and jewel-encrusted collars and they want to be free from superficial and degrading pageants, like these. You were trying to tell me that all along, weren't you, Gary? Well, I won't let it happen again. Did you hear that, Gary? They're rewarding you for standing up and speaking out against injustice. Maybe these pageants aren't so superficial after all. Ahh, nothing quite like a relaxing stroll deep in Jellyfish Fields. I'd know that sound anywhere! It's a terrifying shriek! But where's it coming from? Patrick, what is with all the shrieking? You know I walk here on Tuesdays. Patrick, I know I heard a terrifying shriek. So, you were mimicking it. Patrick, please don't do that. It is really... Wait a minute, if the shriek wasn’t coming from you, then where was it...it’s over there, behind that kelp shrub! The terrifying shriek must've come from this clam. Hey, Patrick, I think there's something wrong with... W-W-What are we gonna do? Oh, and you were coughing because you got something stuck in your throat? Patrick, this clam is choking! Luckily, I come prepared! There, there, Clammy. They like this! Hey, what about the clam? But if... Patrick, the clam had a baby! Well, then, what could it be? Their...eyes? A baby volleyball! Good idea coming here, Patrick. Having good ideas? Maybe we should do some stretches, first. Well, that's my specialty. Nope, doing some stretches, first. 138, 139, Hello. Oh, really? We don’t mind, do we Patrick? We found it deep in Jellyfish Fields. Choking a clam. Whoa. How many more trucks do you think there’ll be, Patrick? Well, that looked like the last of them. Oh, hey, Patrick. Yup…I mean, nope. Wow, your dad really told you that? Hey, Patrick, I know a good place to go when you don’t know what to buy. The mall! Patrick, where’d you go? Oh, there you are. Patrick, that was the best shopping day ever! Best shopping day ever! Patrick, I got an idea! Let’s go shopping again! And this time, buy stuff! Oh, wasn’t that incredible, Patrick? I mean, with all this money, we could’ve bought anything in the whole world! So tell me, what’d you buy? Hey, me, too! And to think we barely even put a dent in my fortune! Two, please: one for me and one for my best friend, Patrick. Thanks. There you go. Oh, that’s okay. I kinda have more money than I know what to do with right now. Are you gentlemen low on funds? Let me help. Here you go. That’s okay, I already got my ice cream. See? Sure thing. Do you need some, too, Bert? Oh, you wanna buy some ice cream? It’s a deal! And I said, go ahead, let’s do it right now! I got too much hair, anyways. That’s my name, don’t wear it out. Oh, Patrick, these aren’t strangers. These are 497 of my closest friends. Right everybody? That right! Patrick, do you hear that? That is the sound of love. Like I was saying… And I told him, it’s not that I mind the macaroni, what I mind is… No matter, he’s simply jealous of my glamorous new lifestyle. Why certainly. I always remember to… Oh, I forgot. I keep it in this other pocket. Uh, will you excuse me for a moment? Noooooooooo! Well, everyone, I hope this doesn’t put a damper on things, but I just checked and, well it’s just that all my money is… …gone. Hey, Patrick. Whatcha doing? Patrick, I was wrong. The money, and about those people being my friends. Patrick, if having a bunch of money makes me forget that forget that you’re my best friend, then I don’t want anymore money, ever again. You got another new volleyball? Found it? Where?  Squidward? My playmate, Patrick is away, at a family reunion. Sad and alone, I am desperate for something to do, or someone to play with. Squidward? Where are you going, all dressed up? Can I come? Are you going to a fancy store? A fancy party? A hot fancy pants date? Can I come? Can I come? Can I come? Can I come? Can I come? Can I come? Can I come? Can I come? Can I come? All except for that last one. Wow. I may not as be you and your buddies, Squidward, but I, too, have a song in my heart I want to share. ♪Laaaaaa.♪ ♪La! La! La! La! La! La!.♪ Yodeleehehoo! I'm good enough to join the Men's Chorus. I promise! Perhaps Squidward didn't see me. This giant pothole ought to get his attention. What a lucky break! Now I have a captive audience! Laaaaa Mimimimimi Looo! Uhm Squidward, could you keep it down please? I'm trying to find my starting pitch here. Laaa! Stop! Stop Stop! I here by issue you with this ticket, for reckless frowning, and failing to listen to my song! That's right! I'm a singing traffic cop! ♪O Sole Lo Mio...♪ ♪Fii-gaa-roo♪ Ooooh! Laaaaaaaaaaa. Figaro, Figaro, Fiii-ga-rooo! Laa, Ohhh, OOOOOOH! Well... I... A mustache?! FOR ME?! Squidward look! My very own choirman's mustache! Uhm... I'll do it! But only if you find a spot for my inspiration, and great friend, Squidward! ♪Fi-ga-ro!♪ Fi-ga-ro Where are you taking us, Mr. Krabs? What do you think the surprise is, Patrick? I don't know. What do you... Ohhh. Whatever it is, it's really big. And it smells angry. You peek first. Hey, who are those guys, Mr. Krabs? They look like they wanna hurt us. The act? Wow. Looks like those Iron Bun workout videos are really paying off. Wow! Can we have cool nicknames too? And together we are... This is going to be so fun. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Okay, we're ready. Actually, we're here to fake wrestle. Oh, excuse me. Did it just get dark in here? Oh, don't be afraid. It's just them. That's Wrestlese for "You're dead meat." Hey, look, Patrick, it's Mr. Krabs cheering us on. Whoa. Hey, Patrick. Look, Patrick, it's a fist. How fun was that? Did you need something, Mr. Krabs? Right! C'mon, Patrick, let's show these two who they're messing with. Alright, you two, no more messing around. You see this? It's just a spatula, right? Wrong! Actually, this represents your face after I get through mangling it. There, you see that? It's not gonna be pretty when I get done with ya. Thanks, Patrick. Now you try saying something intimidating as well. Patrick, are you okay? Really? Me, too. That tickles. Look, I'm a... Fake wrestling. Mr. Krabs, we're having so much fun. Doesn't that make us winners? Oh, hello, Mr. Fluffy. See you at Wrestle Camp, Mr. Krabs! Hey, Quincy! How's my favorite money-man? The new Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy cards come out today! So I need to take out some mon-ey. Sure thing, Quincy, sure thing. I know, I know. It's so embarrassing. I wanted the one with the kittens on it. Thank you. Hm... Um, Quincy, this one is wrinkled. I couldn't possibly give this to Mermaid Man. It simply won't do. This one... smells funny. Well, I'll have you know that this is for Mermaid Man. And I'm not leaving until I have money that shows him the proper respect. Whoa! Hey, Patrick. Counting up your change for a pack of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy trading cards?

Ohhh! I'll never find card fifty-four! No, it's just another... Number fifty-four! That's the best card there is! Aaahhhhh!! Patrick, you're picking your teeth with it! Patrick! That's the ultra-rare number fifty-four talking card! It's really valuable and there's only five in existence. And Patrick! Blah blah blzzz! So now do you understand why you should take really could care of that card? I can't let anything happen to that card. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy would never forgive me! Patrick, watch out! You almost tripped on that crack. Whew! Now watch where you're going! Patrick, look out! Ha, that was close. Patrick, this is serious. You're carrying precious cargo now. You can't just wander aimlessly around like you've been... The card! Patrick, why'd you just walk into Goo Lagoon? Ahhh! Here we are! Home safe home! And nothing happened to the card. The super-rare and priceless Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy trading card! Patrick! Where is it? Where is it? Dear Neptune! You didn't put it in your pocket, did you? It's getting all bent up! Bent up! Bent up! Bent up! Bent, bent, bent, bent up! You mean... you'd give me your most valuable possession? You're the best pal ever. Sure, pal. Anything for you. Um, sure, Patrick. Patrick, wait!

Mr. Krabs... it's beautifu- Mr. Krabs, what's a Viking? How long? And? Hi, Squidward! Mr. Krabs said you were gonna teach me all about the Vikings. Will ya teach me, huh?! Whoa.... Squidward, do you think Vikings really drink their beverages in Viking Size? Do you think that- But- There's so much more about Vikings that I wanna find out. Thanks, Squidward! Dear Vikings, I am writing to ask you guys about your lives and stuff. If you would take the time to answer all my neat questions, then that would be really swell. What's that, Squidward? I couldn't here ya. I was.... ooh. Uh, I think so. Huzzah! How interesting. What a fascinating culture. I can't believe how much I'm learning. Nice to meet ya. Wait! I still have lots more questions about the Vikings' way of life. Well, like... what do the Vikings like to do for fun? Anything else? Anything else? I'll let you know if I think of anything. Well, Mr. Krabs tells me I'm pretty good with a spatula. A Promotion. Congratulations, Squidward! Wait! You can't do that. If it means saving my best friend, then yes. But.... But, but I... Guys, you just ran into a piece of ice. No one's forsaken you. There's a breach in the hull over there. You just gotta patch it up. What's that for? But, how ya gonna patch up a leak with that? Pardon me, Squidward! Thanks. There. Here goes nothing! Now that's what I call a Viking-sized adventure! There's only one problem! ...I can't. I'll be in boating school at 8 a.m. tomorrow. And tarnish my reputation of never missing one day of school? No, I couldn't. Besides, that would be lying. And lying is wrong. Oh! Take a... take a bathroom break! But what if I don't need to use the bathroom? Patrick, is this really neces— Patrick? You feeling all right? Nothing. Nothing. That's it! I won't go to the bathroom ‘til tomorrow. And when I have to go, I'll really have to... ...go. Nneee just a little... woo! Woo! I gotta, nnnnn, gotta go to the... The bathroom key! Nnnnn, thank you, Mrs. Puff. Nnnnn... Thanks. Will do. Nnnnn... Hi, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, will you sign our books? Okay, that was fun. Well, I should really start heading back to class. But what about my class? Wait up! You don't even have a net! Patrick! Wow. Neptune's scepter, I don't believe this! How'd you do that? Wow! Oh boy, you weren't kidding! You're free to go, guys. Oh, come on, I don't have time for this. Patrick, have you forgotten I gotta go?  Well, this certainly has been a glorious day, but I better get back to class. Oh, you said it buddy. I'm sorry, Sandy, but I just gotta get back to class. No! I gave Mrs. Puff my word, and I shall not betray her! Okay, maybe just one game. Patrick, you know how to play this game? Is this the one when the lowest score wins? Here it comes! Hey, I'm getting pretty good at this game!   Well, I better be off now. Well, if it's for the fans, well maybe I can play one game more. C-c-c-c... ...criminal!? I gotta go back to class! I can't be a ditcher! Almost there. Just have to get past the... ...Bikini Bottom Hug Fest? No, no, no, no... Miss, if you don't let me go right now, I might have to turn into a criminal! Whaaa! Whoa! The tar pits? Ah! I'm sinking! Well, I guess this is the end, SquarePants. But like the old saying goes, "Better to end up sinking into a prehistoric lake of tar, then to turn to a life of crime!" Goodbye, world. Goodbye, Mrs. Puff. I'll always cherish those last kind words that you said to me.  Ohh! I never returned Mrs. Puff's bathroom key! I can't give up now!  I made it! And a minute before the final bell. I am home free. Mrs. Puff... I'm really sorry! Please forgive me! I don't know what happened! Everything just got away from me! I brought back your bathroom key, though! Okay, Mrs. Puff. I'll never ditch again! I promise. I didn't know your grandpa was a pirate, Mr. Krabs. Why don't we just make the Krusty Krab look like a pirate ship. We've got Squidward. And I could get Patrick to join up. Swarthy! I mean...shiver me timbers!   Um... Ahoy, Captain! We be catchin' a mighty gale from the northeast. Oh!  Woo-hoo!  ♪ Workin' at the Krusty Krab! Workin' at the Krusty Krab! La, la, la, la! Loo...♪ Squidward? Squidward? Squidward, are you okay? Mr. Krabs! It happened again, Mr. Krabs! It's Squidward! What is it about the third Wednesday of every month that makes Squidward so happy? These camouflage outfits should help us find out what Squidward's secret Wednesday secret is! Yeah! Way to go! Do we get to join the lodge? Huh! How did you know? Maybe he got to join the lodge! Or... maybe not. They didn't let you join either? Hey, where's Squidward? You still have your robes.  Don't you worry, Squidward. I'm sure if Patrick and I just explain what happened, they're sure to let you back in. We just came to explain that Squidward had no idea that we followed him to the lodge. So, it's not his fault. No, it wasn't your fault, Patrick. No. You can't set foot in the lodge. Squidward, wait! I'm sorry we got you kicked out of your lodge. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you? That's it! Squidward! We'll make our own club! And it'll be so much better than that dumb old Cephalop-olaphapa Lodge! And you can be our leader! How great does that sound, O Mighty One?! Wanna join our club, Patrick? Squidward, you're the lodge expert. What do we do first? So anyway, Squidward, I was thinking we should be working on our secret lodge initiation. Patrick and I have come up with a secret hand-shake.  Not the way we do it. Oh, sure he does. He just needs a little push. Let's move. Okay, we can let him out now. Oh, we didn't kidnap you. We just brought you here for... A very special initiation. Would you care to go first, Brother Patrick? Ow! Ooo, ooo! Ow! Brother Patrick? They sure aren't. They're your uniform for your new lodge! Welcome to the first official meeting of...The Feather Friends. Somebody already had Feather Buddies. Do you still wanna be a Feather Friend? Aw...Squidward, I hadn't realized how special your lodge was to you. I'll get you back in that club. And I know just how to do it. Everything we need is in this drawer. Not just a sock...a disguise. Patrick and I will climb inside the sock and pretend to be a giant albino eel. We will then gain entrance to the lodge, and frighten everyone inside. Once they're good and terrified, you, Squidward, will storm in, defeat that giant eel, and rescue all the lodge members. You'll be a hero, Squidward. They'll have to let you back in the lodge! It is. Time to break out the heavy artillery. Roar! Roar! Way to go, Squidward. Don't worry, Squidward. We still have the Feather Friends. Hey, Squidward. Pretty incredible shift, huh? Any plans after work? Yeah, me neither. Just gonna be hangin' at 'Casa de Esponja'. Feel free to drop by if you're in the neighborhood. Hey, Squidward. Wait up! Squidward! I realized I really didn't extend a proper invitation back there. So what do ya say, Squidward? How about you come over to my house for a visit tonight? . Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? . Oh, please come over for a visit, Squidward! It's been so long. I can't even remember your last visit. Please? Please? Please?! Please?! Please?! Please? Please? Please? Please? Please? Please, please? Pleeeaase? Pleaaaaaase? Please? Please? Okay, Squidward. Maybe some other time. Hey-ho, Squidward. You got any... What if I got a couple of throw pillows? . Patrick? Has Squidward ever visited you at home? He said he wouldn't leave the comfort of his own home for my "dirty little hovel". That's it! Oh, hey, Squidward! Just doin' a little home improvement. Oh-okay, Squidward. Dear Squidward, Thanks For lending me your vacuum cleaner! Sincerely, SpongeBob SquarePants. ... Oh, P.S. SquarePants residence. Squidward! It's been a while since I last got a call from my favorite next-door neighbor! I didn't steal it, silly, I borrowed it. You won't even recognize the place, Squidward! Oh, Squidward is finally coming over for a visit! Squidward! I've been expecting you! Welcome to my humble abode! I hope that you will find comfort. And please don't hesitate to ask me if there's anything I can... Well, you said you wouldn't leave the comfort of my home, so I brought the comfort here! Isn't it great?! Would you care for a cool and refreshing iced tea? Hot hors d'oeuvres? Nachos? Blancmange? Yes, of course. Please take a seat while I go grab your vacuum. Please make yourself at home! Enjoying your visit so far, Squidward? Okay, Squidward, just yell if you need anything. You yelled? Then okay! Make yourself at home! Squidward sure seems to be enjoying his visit. Did someone say "rash cream?" Squidward, the rash cream. Oops. Oh, no! I don't think I have a cream for that. So, are you enjoying your stay at 'Chez Spongè?' Tsk. Hurry back, Squidward! Aw, don't worry, Squidward. You're more than welcome to stay at my home until you get your house fixed. Squidward? You okay? Squidward? Squidward! It sure was nice having Squidward over for a visit, eh, Gary? It's laundry day, Gary! Oops. ) Now to finish the day's chores. Hello? Mm, speaking. Actually, Patrick, I'm kind of busy. Can it wait? Gary, go check on the laundry in the dryer. Yeah, Patrick. Gary? They've shrunk! I'm gonna need to get new pants. Oh. No. Nope. Ew, not these. Uh-uh. Whoa, these pants hug my body better than my own mother! Hey, Patrick! Notice anything different? Pose. Pose. Pose. Pose. It's me, SpongeBob. Patrick is so full of tartar sauce. I'm still me. It's just a pair of pants. It's not like my friends won't recognize me. Sandy didn't recognize me either. These pants are more powerful than I thought. Course it was just Sandy, and Neptune knows what goes on inside a squirrel's head. But I know my best buddy Squidward will recognize me. We have been through so much together. Hi, Squidward! Oh, Squidward! Guess who? Oh, sure you do. It's me, SpongeBob... SquarePants. Well, maybe these pictures of us together will job your memory. Me and you at my birthday party. You and me at work. That little slumber party we had last week. I forgot when this was taken. Squidward didn't know me either. It's like we'd never met. Maybe Patrick is right. Oh no, it's locked. Gary! Hey, Gary! Can you open the door?! I left my keys in the other pants. Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob. Patrick, what are you doing in my house? Oh, barnacles! I guess I'm not 'SpongeBob SquarePants' anymore. I'll have to start all over again. Hello, sir. I'd like an application, please. My name is SpongeBob Sq... Sorry, I'm a little... I'm a little... I'm a little nervous. My name is SpongeBob... RoundPants. And I would like to seek employment at this eating establishment. Oh, dear! Are you ok, Mr. Cashier? Ooh! Here are the applications. Let's see here. "Name." SpongeBob RoundPants. Well, this is going well. Hey, Mr. Cashier, looks like we're gonna be coworkers! Question two. "Have you ever been convicted of a felony?" Hmm, what's a felony? Oh, yeah! Lots and lots of felonies. I'm filling out an application. Then I got the job?! My first day on the job. I am so excited. Woo-hoo! You've worked here a long time. Why don't you show this rookie the ropes? Yay! So what do I do first? Shouldn't you watch it? Ooh, very Zen. What next, oh, oracle of Krabby wisdom? Hmm, I'll go, too. How's it going in there, boss? Going fine. Oh, Mr. Squidward... Whatcha reading? Bathroom break. Check. Be rude to customers and insult food. Nasally laugh. No. Oh I think you've had way too many of those. I am not SpongeBob SquarePants, Mr. Krabs. I mean, do these pants look square to you? They're round. I can't be SpongeBob SquarePants with round pants. Patrick. Order up, Squidward. Don't they look peaceful? Hi, Mermai... Umph! I can't believe Mermaid Man hit me with his Mermerang... It's so awesome! Oh, sure thing. Hey, It came back! I'll try again. I know! I've got it! Hi... How ya feeling? Okay! Oh! I almost forgot! I brought you flowers! Since you two are feeling so poorly. Patrick, go home and check your mailbox. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... Patrick and I can do it, Mermaid Man! Because, we're card carrying members of the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy fan club. We're also certified Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy impersonators. We're ready! Man Bob! Got it! Shuffle boarding is exciting, huh, Patrick? What's your favorite thing about shuffle boarding? Shu-ee-uu-ee-ufflelele-board! It is fun! What? Um, Patrick? We already won the tournament. You did, it's in your back pocket. Okay. Patrick! Stop! We can't. We have to get the costumes back. Nobody? Their mommies? Patrick! Don't you think that's too harsh? Wasting a Krabby Patty?! How could you?! Well, maybe somebody should have thought about that before they ponied up for the world's greatest patty! Mr. Jail Warden! You're right, Patboy! This town needs us! Your shoe's untied! Oh, I think we've done our work, Patrick. Now, let's return these costumes. That's the evil Man Ray! Look at him, Patrick! Plotting with his evil minion! I'll bet he's handing off some secret weapon! Time to crash this party! Hello, Man Ray! Who's your friend? Alright, Mable, that's enough chitchat! Now are you gonna come quietly, or will we have to take you to jail by force!? Playing dumb, eh? Hiiiiiii-ya! Eat dryer sheets, Man Ray! Whooooaaaaa! Not so fast, Man Ray! You're all wet, you need to dry out. Just keep moving. Well, our work is done here. Just doing our Mermaduty. And then some! That's a good one! They have so many fans! Hey, look! It's Squid... Wow, only eight minutes in and we've already been given a math quiz. Very advanced music class, huh, Patrick? Sure! Patrick's New Year's resolution was to learn to play an instrument! And I have been very happy with the results. See? I'm sorry, Professor Squilliam. Patrick here keeps tickling my foot. Alright, it was me. Mm hmm! Like this. Hey, my mom has one of those in her garden! My whole life has been pointed in one direction. Wha...? Where am I? I felt like I was in some sort of horrible trance. Well, I guess if I was to say one thing, it would have to be: We're sorry, Squidward. Okay, Patrick! Here I come! Patrick, maybe we should play something that involves less thinking. Hey! Maybe we can play a game with this ball that was buried under here! Well, who knows how long it ... Ah! Mother of Neptune! Get away from me! Get away from me! You're right, Patrick. I'm sorry we destroyed your nest little worm. I promise it won't happen again. Look, Patrick! Yeah. Hey! Why don't we invite Mr. Wormsley to stay at my place? At least until his nest grows back. Gary! Make yourself descent. You have a visitor. Gary, wake up Patrick, just bring in here, careful now, that's right. Oh, hi, Gary, are you ready to meet your new friend. That's right, say hello to Mr. Wormsley. Come on, little guys, let's take five and be friendly now. See just say hi. That's it, that's it And there you go. See? Friends. Oh my goodness! Patrick, please do something. Aaaaaaaaaahhh....... Okay, Patrick, see you later then. Aaaaaaaahhhh...... All right, Gary, so there isn't more upset, you're going to sleep at the guest newspaper tonight, while Mr. Wormsley is sleeping here with me. Now, now, Gary don't be rude. See? I set it all nice just for you. There you are. Good night, Gary. Must have been Patrick is doing his night fits again. Okay I'll just close the window. Mr. Wormsley! Woaaaaahh! I'll be right back, Mr. Wormsley. I'm gonna go get help. Whatever's wrong with you, don't move! He's in here. Oh! I can't watch! Oh! Patrick, it’s a miracle. Wait 'till Gary sees. Here, Gary, right in here. They're gone asleep. He's chased her away! Now, who will care for her abandoned newborn infants? I dunno, Patrick. I've never seen Gary that upset. I guess we'll just have to find homes for each and every one of them. Right, Pat? Patrick? How would you like to have your very own pet baby worms? Baby worms. So, how many did you want? Good morning, Mrs. Puff. Would you like a baby worm? Uh, I'll just come back later, Mrs. Puff. Have a nice day! Don't worry, little worms. I know a place where we can find go to find homes for every single one of you. Good morning, ma'am. How are you today? Could I interest you in some... Ma'am? That whistling. It's Larry Lobster! Hi, Larry, what are you up to? Probably not. So I see. Oh, Larry, wait. Okay. I was just gonna see if you wanted one of these poor, lonely baby worms. Well, yeah! Really? Larry, no! Oh, little wormies, I'm so glad you're safe. Now let's go see about finding you those homes I promised. Hello? I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs, I came as fast as I could-- I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. My pet worm had babies and got chased away. Now I've got to find them all a place to live. Yeah. Really? Well, okay. Oh, he likes you. Oh, well. At least I still have you guys. Enjoy your new home, little guy. That sure was a great idea you had, Mr. Krabs. What's that? Hey, Squidward, look! I figured out how to get my mop wet without dipping it in the bucket. Um... hello... what do you want robot thing, sir? Oh, hey Plankton! What are you doing here? Uhhhhh, uuh uuh. Krabs give me secret formula or... uhhh... what was that other thing? We're all doomed, we're all doomed, we're all doomed, we're all doomed, doomed, doomed, doomed, doomed, doomed, we're all doomed, we're all doomed, we're all doomed, we're all doomed! Ahoy, sir. Where are you going? You have a secret? Aye-aye, sir. And who will be "in charge" while you're gone. What? I'm... in charge? Yahow! I won't let you down, sir. Naptime's over, Squidward. Now what do you say we work real hard until Mr. Krabs comes back? Yep. And I'm in charge for the next 15 minutes. Yeah, I'm kind of a big deal around here. I guess that's why Krabs put me in charge. Charge. Charge. Do you care now? Heh-heh. Everything is under control, people. Go back to your Krabby Patties. Nothing your temporary man in charge can't handle. Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Squid? Squid? Squidward? Squid? Squid? Well, it's just that I'm in charge and... Regulary scheduled nap? Really? Well, I, um... Um, nothing. Carry on. Boy, there sure is a lot of procedural type stuff I don't know about the Krusty Krab. Order up, Squidward! Gosh, I'd love to, Squidward, but I've got to cook the patties. And unclog the sink. What kind of secret? Yes? Me? Hey, buddy. It's me, SpongeBob, fry cook extraordinaire. I know your secret... Oh, a little cashier told me! Follow me! Betcha didn't think you'd be in here today, did ya? First off, this is my grill. This is where the magic happens! And this is my actual spatula! So start fryin' up some patties! I'll come check on you later, my little prodigy! Order number 12! Taking out an order! They are? Oh! . It's all coming clear to me now. There you are. A nice hot meal with sanitary foot service. Here's a nice delicious Krabby Patty, and a large drink. Enjoy. Ooh! It's here, it's here, it's here, it's here! Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo it's here! Now that I'm in charge, I've decided to decorate the Krusty Krab! I'm gonna make it all pretty! Oh, Squidward. I'm in charge, so you'll be having all the fun. Painting the walls, buffing the tables, sewing pretty curtains, washing the windows, varnishing the stools, hanging the ferns, waxing the toilets. Oh, you lucky dog! There's another secret? What's the secret? How? Sounds like the Chum Bucket. Oh... How's this, Squidward? You mean, "lookin' bad!" Enjoy our fine décor! One Krusty Krab, covered in mud and slime! Got it! Gum under all the tables! How's that for low expectations? Initiating stage two: collateral damage! How was that? Ehh... Squidward, all the customers are leaving! Don't touch the material. Oh, can do, Squidward, can do! Wait! You don't want to miss... This! And a hey, and a ho, and a hey and a ho! And a hey, ho, hey, ho, hey, ho, ha, hey, hee, ho... I was just following Squidward's advice, Mr. Krabs. He told me all your secrets! Hello? Oh, hiya, Sandy! Sure! What's up? I will be there! Of course not! Have I ever let you down before? Hello? With Gary as my witness, I won't let you down, Miss Cheeks! I won't let Sandy down! I won't let Sandy down! I won't let Sandy down! I won't let Sandy down! I won't let Sandy down! Good morning, cap'n! I won't let Sandy down! I won't let Sandy down, down! I won't let Sandy down! Right after work I'm going over to Sandy's, who I'm not gonna let down. Yes, sir? "Telescope Assembly Manual"... Tonight? Umm... Well, actually... What am I gonna do? You can do it. You made the commitments, you have to honor them. Both of them. Oh, hiya, Patrick. What're you doing back here? No need to remind me! I wouldn't forget about my best buddy's birthday! What words? Uhh... Tonight? Oh, Neptune! This is worse than I ever could've imagined! Right! Time to be all I can be! Man, these people sure look science-y. Sandy must be pulling out all the stops for this one. Hey, Sandy! What'cha doing? I gotta help Mr. Krabs! Uh, Sandy, I gotta run to the, uh, gents' room. Now, if I finish up with Mr. Krabs, that'll clear me up to assist Sandy! You can rely on me, sir! I wouldn't wanna jeopardize my employee record. Okay, let's see what we got here. Oh, it says on page 472, section C-17, that you need a right-angled motorized hex drill to assemble this thing. I... "Dear valued Tom's Toolery customers, we are closed this week in observance of Porpoise Day. Please call again." Barnacles! Where can I find a motorized hex drill now? Sandy! Heh, oh, hey, Patrick! What're you doing in town? Forget? How can I forget my best friend's birthday party? Ha, ha! No, I haven't!... Have I? Oh, yeah, that! I w... I was just getting to that! That's why I was here in town! Forget your birthday cake! You're hilarious, Star, you really are! Now, you just go home, and I'm gonna go get your cake, you silly guy, you! Hi! I need a birthday cake! "Sorry About the Scabies". Um, can you change it to say "Happy Birthday"? Yeah, here you are. Sandy's drill! Oh, hi! I was just, uh, making sure you had your hardware! Oh, I just thought I'd be a little festive, you know, for the scientists... What? It must be that spicy kelp I ate earlier. I gotta go use the lavatory. I'll be right back! Happy birthday! Yeah, there was a, uhh... Big... Traffic... Storm. Your present? I've got it, it's right here! Ta-da! See, all wrapped up and ready to go! The cake! I must've left it at Sandy's! No! I said "The bakery delivers, isn't that handy?". In fact, I think I hear them right now outside! Wait there while I go check. Oh, barnacles. The telescope! Uh, Sandy, I hate to delay the proceedings, but, uh, I forgot to mail in this mail-in rebate and, uh... I'll be right back. Okay, let's get started, Mr. Krabs. Sardines! Yeah, I was attacked by a can of wild sardines. Now let's finish this telescope. Ugh! I left it at Patrick's rock! Never mind that, could I please borrow your present? Not even for a minute? Okay, I'll be right back! I've got something to say. I've got something to say. I've got so... I have got something to say! I know you all had important things tonight. Mr. Krabs, your telescope, Patrick, your birthday, and, Sandy, you have this big presentation. I just couldn't say "no" to any of you. Aw. You know, you guys are right. It was silly to think I could be in 3 places at once. Patrick! What are you doing out here, silly? That's because this is my work hat, Patrick. I have to wear it when I go to work. I'm afraid it doesn't work that way, buddy. Don't worry, Patrick. I'll be back from work at six. We can play then. What's shakin', Mr. K? Oh, he is good. What's the matter, Patrick? He's nervous. Patrick. Are you okay? That's it, buddy. Come on. Patrick had a bloody nose, so I was going to walk him home. Hey, hat man... How are you feeling after your first day on the job? Patrick? Patrick, are you all right? Say something! Okay, that's it! No best friend of mine is gonna suffer permanent brain trauma just so Mr Krabs can make a quick buck. I'm gonna go have a talk with him right- Okay, buddy, I understand. Just promise me one thing. Just be careful. I'm worried about Patrick. I'm not sure his new job is good for him. Patrick! Mr. Krabs, you can't let him do this, he might get hurt! Oh, I can't watch! So it was your hat that was making you fall the whole time! Patrick, you okay? It's okay, Patrick, not everyone is equipped to bear the awesome weight of responsibility that a uniform hat represents. But you can wear mine any time you want. Sure thing, pal. Anytime, pal! Anytime! Huh...... Patrick? Whaddya wanna do today? Well, I guess we could play something. How about a yo--? Yo. Buried Treasure Board Game? Dollies? How about this? Hey, we could play with our Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy action figures! Ew. Barnacle Boy's all chewed up. And slimy. Ugh, there is just nothing to play with. Hi, Squidward. Can you think of anything fun we can do?  Welcome to Bikini Bottom's newest... Toy store?! Ahhhhh! Oh yeah! Well, we're here. Well, I guess it's not open yet. I got it. Patrick! Patrick, get up... Look. Wow! Patrick, look at that. That depends. Tell me. Do you like to sing?! Ahem! ♪La... ♪Toys! Glorious toys! La, la, la! Toys! Yeah!♪ Hey, Patrick. It's not a tutu! It's a man-tu! You can tell because it has extra support. I got the last one. What a great day! I hope it never ends! Aw. The store's closing. We'll have to leave now. Patrick, we have to leave. But they'll just come and kick us out! Hide? Isn't that kinda sneaky? No. But I do now. What do we do first?! Thanks, pal. Well, we did it. Yay! Nothing can ruin it! Patrick, is that you? I said, "Is that you?" You have Night Vision? How long have you had that? Oh, yeah. Calm down, buddy. We just need to find a light switch. But ya have to put me down first. Yes. By... toys? Gah! Eeeeeeee! No. No. We're going to fight back and we are going to win! Ready, Patrick? It was nice knowin' ya, pal. Patrick, don't! My eyes! Get up, Patrick! It's time! The big shin-dig! Remember? That's shin dig, buddy. We're spending the day at the beach in the honor of our best friendship. Uhhh... Sure. A little sunscreen and I'm sure you'll be fine! I'm spending the whole day at the beach with my best friend. Guess what? I'm going to the beach with my best friend! Ooohhhh buuusss drrrivvver! Okay, out of everybody on this bus, guess which one is my best friend? You know what this situation calls for. Patrick! A few verses of the best friend tune! ♪Ohhhh best fr-♪ Hey! Wait! This is not our stop! Oh, how are we going to get to the beach now, Patrick? We don't even know where we are. No! No! Patrick! No one is ever going to find us out here! Look, Patrick! We made it! Hey best friend? Check this out! It's a small plastic disc that you throw! I do, too, buddy. If only small plastic disc that you throw had a shorter, catchier name. Perfect! Now run along, Patrick, and I'll toss it to you! Ready?! Nonsense, Patrick. There are plenty of fun things to do in the sand. We can draw, or practice our cursive writing, or... I know, we can make sand castles! No one's ever been annoyed by a sand castle. Nothing quite like the joy of sand castling, eh, buddy? How ya doing over there? Oh, a structure like that can't protect a king and his subjects. Here, let me help you. First, you should start all over. I'm just trying to help, buddy! Well, I suppose I should just tend to the affairs of my own realm. And I'll start by making a queen to rule by your side. All right, Patrick, have it your way. "You keep to your territory and I'll keep to mine. I better build a wall just in case King Pinky gets any funny ideas. Oh, sir, you built onto my side. So, you don't do that! There! That restores the integrity of our shared border. But what for what!? Okay, Patrick, I can accept that. No more destruction from this point forward, okay? Okay, back to square one again. I hereby propose a non-aggression treaty to end hostilities between our two kingdoms. Patrick, by signing this historic armistice you have brought peace to our lands. May your kingdom prosper! Well that went well!" What are you doing!? What about the treaty!? Oh, is that so!?" Well, if you think you can take down this castle, my answer is bring it on! Patrick, I'm trying to be the nice guy here, okay? Let's call this silly business off. Fine! Have it your way. Come on! How do you like them apples Uh huh... mmm hmm. Well put, general! We'll create a surprise military diversion and break through enemy lines. What say you? Yes! We'll ready ourselves immediately! How do you like me now? Patrick... Patrick! Are you okay!? All is fair in love and war my friend slash enemy, or should I say, my friend-enemy!? Now let's have some real fun! Jumping jellyfish! WHOA! Ohhhh. I'll tell you what happened, Patrick... I got carried away. No, no, it wasn't. What started out as a fun dream turned into a horrible, brutal, nightmare. As the winds of time changed the silvery sands of these dunes to a new landscape, so let us hope that our own winds of change will change our spiritual dunes to a landscape of peace. Oh buddy, let's never forget this lesson. Oh yeah? I bet you can't! No, I can! I can! Phew! Hello, hello! Huh? The line’s been cut. Barnacles! I guess I’d go better take a look. Who's there? Stay back, I'm armed. Whoa! Whoa! Ha, hey! Ah Ha! Wind-Up novelty teeth. How did you wind up down here . What the heck is going on with my fancy boot? Hey, knock it off! Alright, I warned you! You're a dirty fighter! Hmm, I gotcha now! Hi ya! Gary? Noooooooooo! GARY! Hooa! Phew, thank goodness. For a moment there, I thought you were hurt. Gary, I... I broke your shell! Oh no! You're in pain! Don't worry, I'll make it better. Sorry about that. Oh, I know! Here, just use a little tape and theerrre ya go, good as new! Oh. Well, that's alright, because we'll find a new shell for ya! How about this? Yeah, you’re right, too gaudy. No, too last season. Well, I need that. A-haha, look, Gary. Here, try this on for size. Of course it's a shell! Oh, c'mon, don't look at me like that. . Okay, you’re right, it's not a shell. OH! Greetings, earthlings. I am SpongeBob. I come from the future. DA-HA-HA-DA-HA-HA. I bet this'll look great. . Eeewww. I can see why snail shells aren't clear. Hmmmm. Here it is, Gary. Your neeew shell! Oh, you look ready to ride! Shell Spiffy. Great idea, Gare, I'll order you a new shell. Are there any you have your mind on, ol' buddy? Oh, page 72. Oh, here it is. Wow! . This stylish, fully insulated, dual coat ceramic shell comes with automatic restroom facilities standard, and for the affordable price of $9,595.95! Isn't there a place I can get a quality shell without spending a fortune!? Commercial? What commercial? Oh, sorry, Angry Jack, eh, Gary here needs a new shell, and we knew you would help us find one. Hey, shouldn't you be yelling at me right now? Oh, it's perfect! Just like the old one hey, buddy? Now, it... really looks like the old one, eh, buddy? Oooohh, that's nice, love the pattern. We'll take it, but first I gotta make sure it's battened down. We don't want this one slippin' off, eh, buddy? Oops. Hey, what about that one? Oops, sorry, Jack. Hey, how much is that one? Good idea, Angry. Well it... certainly is shiny. Ah, that is bright. Can't... see! OW, what was that!? Why... can't... I... stop... break-ing... shells!? Whoops. Hey, Jack, I don't suppose you have any more to show me? Wait, wait, wait! Before we do the hand-off, let me make some precautionary measures. Okay, first, shoes are tied, hands are de-ry and now, a thick layer of bubble wrap. You, er... sure you don't have any more in the back? Well, look on the bright side, I reduced your inventory for ya. Are you really angry or ya just trying to sound louder? Take it, it's all my savings. Sorry, that's all I got, honest. Yeah. Okay. Oh, Gary. How I wish your shell could grow back like my appendages. Hey, I've got an idea! Oh, Gary, it's not that bad! Square looks good on anybody! Oh, what am I kidding? It looks terrible on you! I know, Gary, I ruined your life! Do you have to rub it in?!? Mr. Krabs. What are you doing here? I destroyed Gary's shell, and now I can't find a replacement... So I guess he'll just spend the rest of his days as a lowly slug! Mr. Krabs, perhaps you can help me find a new shell for Gary. Nothing, Mr. Krabs. I'm broke. Wait, Mr. Krabs! If you help me get Gary a shell, I'll, work for free for the rest of the year. Deal! Oh, another bad dream. Mr. Krabs? Oh, sorry, Gary, I'm not used to your new shell. There ya go, Mr. Krabs. I guess "All's shell that ends shell". Huh, Gary? That's a good one! Gary? Gary? Gary?! Yes, sir? I'm on it. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Ah! Goofy Goober is going non-dairy? Ooh. Slide show.

And that's the story of how I got my head stuck in the fry vat. Hold on! Did you hear that? It sounds like... ...despair. No. No. Not bitterness. Despair. And it's coming from over... this way. Plankton! What's wrong, Plankton? Come on. Tell your Uncle SpongeBob. Aww...what present did you buy your wife, huh? What'd you buy her? We've got a love emergency! Attention everyone, we've got a love emergency! Please stand back. Love emergency. Thank You. Love emergency. Plankton, there's only one thing you need to do.

Your— never mind. Good idea. Here we go. Patrick, help me get these boards nailed up. Start dec— you sir, obviously do not recognize fine decorating when you see it. Admire it later, Patrick. Right now, we got to get my house converted into a shelter capable of withstanding extreme weather. Actually, I can't. Because I just stepped on one of these nails. Whoo! Nice work, buddy. Now my house can withstand anything nature has to throw at us. Squidward! Did you come to weather out the storm with us? The one Preflumster told us about. C'mon Squidward, it'll be fun! While the elements rage outside, we'll snuggle in here and pass the time by playing board games, and playing tic-tac-toe, and drinkin' hot cocoa, and playing tic-tac-toe, and doing jigsaw puzzles, and watchin' TV, and drinkin' hot cocoa, and doing jigsaw puzzles, and playin' board games, and drinkin' hot tea... Oh, yeah. Hot cocoa... we'll be drinking. Even if I let you borrow my huggly snuggly bunny slippers? Okay, but you better think fast. Because Patrick really likes my— Squidward, welcome back! Here's your slippers. That's better. Squidward, the lights went out. Patrick! What is it? Thank you, Patrick. Okay, boys, let's roll to see who goes first. Oh, yeah. Two. Oh, it's a tie. Tie. Tie. Yeah, it looks like a lot of junk. Yeah, relax, Squidward. We're just here to have fun. Oh, okay, yeah, okay. Here we go. Congratulations, Squidward. Come on, Patrick. You can do it. Be the puzzle piece. Come on, Grandpa, you can do it. You still got a good few years left in you. Go, Patrick, go! Go, Patrick, Go! Go, Patrick, go! Go, Patrick, go! Go, Patrick, go! Hang on, Squidward. Patrick was just about to figure out where this last piece of the puzzle goes. Weren't you, Patrick?! Squidward. It wasn't your turn. That's cheating. Oh, it's okay, Squidward. We'll just start over. Oh, welcome back, Squidward. We were about to figure out where the first piece of the puzzle goes. Oh, maybe Squidward can help us fig— Please, Squidward? Please... What is it? I have a question. Where are you going to get the chalk? Halt! Nobody's to cross this boundary. If you're the one who drew it, let me see some identification papers. Hmm. You may be telling the truth. But then again, you may not. Come with me. We shall find out the truth. Stop that cephalopod! This, I cannot allow. It is against the rules. Patrick, look out! Your food? Apparently so. Well, that and a refrigerator full of food anyways. It's just Patrick gnawing on his can. I don't hear anything. Squidward, wait! Order up Squidward! I'll bet you're wondering why I'm not using my hands today. OK, OK, I'll tell you. I'm not using my hands because today is "Work Without Your Hands Day". You should give it a whirl, buddy. Krusty Krab, SpongeBob speaking. Just a minute please. Mr. Krabs, it's a Queen Amphitrite. She wants to have King Neptune's birthday party here. So much for "Work Without Your Hands Day," SquarePants. You answer to a higher calling this day. I have the capability! OK, that's enough Patrick, thank you. All set, Mr. K. 5,000 patties, one for every year Neptune's been alive. Excuse me, Mr. Royal Sea Kingness, your table is this way,sir. Triton, Triton, Triton? Is there a Triton here? Is there anybody missing from this party that any of you guys can see? Oh, I was sure there's somebody..Oh! Here it is right here. An empty seat. No, not that chair, your Highness. That one, see? It even has its pretty name card that I made still on it. T-R-I-T-O-N. You sure you don't know anyone named Triton? Should I put it down yes or no? Oh no. This is all my fault because I mentioned Triton. Stop, Squidward, please stop! Your descriptions are too horrifying for my delicate sensibilities. Hey, that's it! I'll fix all this by reuniting Neptune with his son! Thanks again, Mr. Bus Driver! Now, all I've got to do is find King Neptune's long-lost son. What the—I had the strangest dream that I just got hit in the head with a tiny toenail clipping. Hey, I was right! It is a tiny toenail clipping. Another one! Plus some rope. Who said that? Show yourself! I'm warning you. I know how to use these! Oh, hello, little fella. Maybe you can help me. Because if I don't find Triton soon, Krabs is gonna be real upset, because he spent a lot of money on party decorations. For King Neptune's birthday! You mean, you're King Neptune's son? Well, he sure seemed upset that you weren't at his birthday party. Well, thanks, but... You're right. It just doesn't make any sense. I mean, gods shouldn't have to use nail clippers. They should be able to wear their fingernails to whatever length they want! Don't go. What if there was a way to free you from this magical cage? Then, you could come to your father's birthday party and settle your differences! Sorry, I haven't had anything to drink in a couple of days, my throats a little dry. I'm sorry, I'll stop talking, I swear boy this really does look complicated, oh I see, I'll just slide this square to the right, this one goes up, one other here and ohh wait, no, ahh, no squares man that really is a tough nut to crack Cheap bag of potato choo wait a minute, which way to the nearest phone booth? Patrick? Oh Patrick, you made it, this is the magical lock I was talking about, Yeah, I tried for hours and hours but I just can't get it to... Wow, all ready, Patrick you know I'll never figure out how you do those so darn fast. Amazing! Wow! Sure Triton, what do you need to use, the bathroom. What's happened here?Hello, where is everybody? the Krusty Krab! But look, that mail hasn't been picked up today. We better use the secret entrance. Be very very quiet. Oh, this is terrible Only as long as King Neptune is locked up. Yeah, Triple Gooberry Sundays tonight after we free them. Make ready the disguise. Okay, now! Quick Patrick, unlock it before he sees us Hurry up Patrick, he's getting bored Did you hear that, Neptune this was all because of me. Yes Patrick? I think now would be an excellent time, yes.
